abstract: The effect of nutrient accumulation resulting from deposition of feces in
  colonies  of colonially breeding and roosting wading birds is estimated in this
  chapter for  breeding and nonbreeding ciconiiform birds in the Everglades ecosystem,
  by  modeling energy consumption and feces deposition rates and by using existing  measurements
  of size, energy, and nutrient content of prey items from the  Everglades. Current
  populations of breeding and nonbreeding birds are estimated  to consume 4.9 fewer
  tonnes of prey (dry mass) per year than the much larger  populations of the 1930s
  and 1940s, equivalent to an estimated 14.6 million fewer  prey items per year. This
  difference translates into 455 fewer tonnes of feces  deposited in roosts and colonies
  per year, roughly equivalent to 59 fewer tonnes  nitrogen and 5.6 fewer tonnes phosphorus.
  Nonbreeding birds are estimated to  account for only 1.5% of the difference in nutrient
  flux attributable to birds between  the two periods, indicating that the differences
  are due to reductions in energyintensive breeding attempts. Although even the largest
  historical populations are  estimated to have redistributed only a very small fraction
  of the total annual  deposition of phosphorus and other nutrients in the marsh,
  loading rates at  colonies can be extremely high. Loading rates at historical colony
  sites could have  been as high as 120 g phosphorus m_2 yr\"1 (approximately 3000
  times the estimated  historic atmospheric deposition rate), while current colonies
  are estimated to have  rates of only 0.9 g phosphorus irr2-yr_1 (more than 20 times
  the historic atmo­ spheric deposition rate). Evidence from the Everglades and other
  ecosystems  suggests that high nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of colonies
  has a strong  effect on the productivity and species composition of aquatic fauna
  and flora. This© St. Lucie Press CCC 0-9634030-2-8 l/94/$100/$.50 571may have strong
  feedback effects for survival of young wading birds, which  characteristically develop
  foraging skills at or near colony sites. Recent relocation  of large colonies from
  the estuarine zone to the freshwater Everglades implies that  nutrient input to
  the estuary has decreased significantly. Nutrient-rich colonies  probably serve
  as islands of refugia for nutrient-tolerant species in the oligotrophic  Everglades
  and may serve to significantly affect the variability in biodiversity of the  marsh.
  Sources of error tend to be in the direction of overestimation of nutrients  transported,
  and in this regard, the amount of food required by nestlings is a central  and poorly
  understood variable.
