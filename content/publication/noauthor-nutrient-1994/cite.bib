 abstract = {The effect of nutrient accumulation resulting from deposition of feces in colonies 
of colonially breeding and roosting wading birds is estimated in this chapter for 
breeding and nonbreeding ciconiiform birds in the Everglades ecosystem, by 
modeling energy consumption and feces deposition rates and by using existing 
measurements of size, energy, and nutrient content of prey items from the 
Everglades. Current populations of breeding and nonbreeding birds are estimated 
to consume 4.9 fewer tonnes of prey (dry mass) per year than the much larger 
populations of the 1930s and 1940s, equivalent to an estimated 14.6 million fewer 
prey items per year. This difference translates into 455 fewer tonnes of feces 
deposited in roosts and colonies per year, roughly equivalent to 59 fewer tonnes 
nitrogen and 5.6 fewer tonnes phosphorus. Nonbreeding birds are estimated to 
account for only 1.5% of the difference in nutrient flux attributable to birds between 
the two periods, indicating that the differences are due to reductions in energyintensive breeding attempts. Although even the largest historical populations are 
estimated to have redistributed only a very small fraction of the total annual 
deposition of phosphorus and other nutrients in the marsh, loading rates at 
colonies can be extremely high. Loading rates at historical colony sites could have 
been as high as 120 g phosphorus m_2 yr"1 (approximately 3000 times the estimated 
historic atmospheric deposition rate), while current colonies are estimated to have 
rates of only 0.9 g phosphorus irr2-yr_1 (more than 20 times the historic atmo­
spheric deposition rate). Evidence from the Everglades and other ecosystems 
suggests that high nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of colonies has a strong 
effect on the productivity and species composition of aquatic fauna and flora. This© St. Lucie Press CCC 0-9634030-2-8 l/94/\$100/\$.50 571may have strong feedback effects for survival of young wading birds, which 
characteristically develop foraging skills at or near colony sites. Recent relocation 
of large colonies from the estuarine zone to the freshwater Everglades implies that 
nutrient input to the estuary has decreased significantly. Nutrient-rich colonies 
probably serve as islands of refugia for nutrient-tolerant species in the oligotrophic 
Everglades and may serve to significantly affect the variability in biodiversity of the 
marsh. Sources of error tend to be in the direction of overestimation of nutrients 
transported, and in this regard, the amount of food required by nestlings is a central 
and poorly understood variable.},
