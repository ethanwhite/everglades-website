abstract: Differential distribution of nutrients within an ecosystem can offer insight
  of ecological and physical processes that are otherwise unclear. This study was
  conducted to determine if enrichment of phosphorus (P) in tree island soils of the
  Florida Everglades can be explained by bird guano deposition. Concentrations of
  total carbon, nitrogen (N), and P, and N stable isotope ratio (δ15N) were determined
  on soil samples from 46 tree islands. Total elemental concentrations and δ15N were
  determined on wading bird guano. Sequential chemical extraction of P pools was also
  performed on guano. Guano contained between 53.1 and 123.7g-Nkg−1 and 20.7 and 56.7g-Pkg−1.
  Most of the P present in guano was extractable by HCl, which ranged from 82 to 97%
  of the total P. Total P of tree islands classified as having low or high P soils
  averaged 0.71 and 40.6gkg−1, respectively. Tree island soil with high total P concentration
  was found to have a similar δ15N signature and total P concentration as bird guano.
  Phosphorus concentrations and δ15N were positively correlated in tree island soils
  (r=0.83, ptextless0.0001). Potential input of guano with elevated concentrations
  of N and P, and 15N enriched N, relative to other sources suggests that guano deposition
  in tree island soils is a mechanism contributing to this pattern.
