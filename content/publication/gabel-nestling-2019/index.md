abstract: Energy transfer is fundamental to ecosystem processes, affecting productivity
  and community structure. Large aggregations of colonially breeding birds are known
  as nutrient sources through deposition of feces, but also may deposit large quantities
  of energy in the form of dead nestlings. The magnitude and ecological relevance
  of this process to the scavenger community is poorly understood. We used trail cameras
  to monitor the fates of size-appropriate chicken carcasses in heron colonies in
  order to quantify the proportion of available fallen nestlings that were consumed
  by scavengers in the Everglades of Florida, USA. Overall, 85% of 160 carcasses were
  consumed, with Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura, 47%) and American Alligators (Alligator
  mississippiensis, 29%) being the primary consumers. Probability of consumption by
  alligators or vultures was related to distance from nest to water, local nesting
  density, and colony type. Consumption probabilities of both scavengers in relation
  to habitat covariates suggested clear resource partitioning promoting coexistence.
  We estimate fallen nestlings throughout this ecosystem could support 16% of the
  alligator population and 147 adult Turkey Vultures during a nesting season. This
  work indicates that fallen nestlings can serve as an important source of energy
  for scavengers at colonial breeding aggregations, particularly in oligotrophic systems.
