abstract: 'Large numbers of colonially nesting herons, egrets, ibises, storks and
  spoonbills were one of the defining natural phenomena of the historical Everglades.
  Reproduction of these species has been tracked over at least a century, and some
  clear responses to dramatic anthropogenic hydrological alterations have been established.
  These include a marked decline in nesting populations of several species, and a
  movement of colonies away from the over-drained estuarine region. Ponding in a large
  portion of the freshwater marsh has favored species that hunt by sight in deep water
  (egrets, cf. 25–45cm), while tactile feeders (ibises and storks) that depend on
  concentrated prey in shallow water (5–25cm) have become proportionately much less
  common. There has been a marked increase in the interval between exceptionally large
  breeding aggregations of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus). Loss of short hydroperiod
  wetlands on the margins of the Everglades have delayed nest initiations 1–2 months
  by Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) resulting in poor nesting success. These responses
  are consistent with mechanisms that involve foraging, and the availability and production
  of prey animals, and each of the relationships is highly dependent on hydrology.
  Here, we define a group of characteristics about wading bird dynamics (= indicators)
  that collectively track the specific ecological relationships that supported ibises
  and storks in the past. We suggest four metrics as indicators of restoration success:
  timing of nesting by storks, the ratio of nesting ibises+storks to Great Egrets,
  the proportion of all nests located in the estuarine/freshwater ecotone, and the
  interval between years with exceptionally large ibis nestings. Each of these metrics
  has historical (e.g., predrainage) data upon which to base expectations for restoration,
  and the metrics have little measurement error relative to the large annual variation
  in numbers of nests. In addition to the strong scientific basis for the use of these
  indicators, wading birds are also a powerful tool for public communication because
  they have strong aesthetic appeal, and their ecological relationships with water
  are intuitively understandable. In the interests of communicating with the public
  and decision-makers, we integrate these metrics into a single-page annual “traffic-light”
  report card for wading bird responses. Collectively, we believe these metrics offer
  an excellent chance of detecting restoration of the ecosystem functions that supported
  historical wading bird nesting patterns.'
