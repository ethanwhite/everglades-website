abstract: Mercury in Everglades food webs poses human health and ecological risks
  most notably to anglers, hunters and fish-eating wildlife. These risks vary spatial
  and temporally across the Everglades landscape. The purpose of this chapter is to
  present an evaluation of temporal trends in mercury bioaccumulation within specific
  links in Everglades food webs. Emphasis is given to assessing temporal trends in
  biotically important species (see Chap. 8, Vol. II for food web descriptions of
  mosquitofish, largemouth bass, wading birds, and the Florida panther); however,
  multiple additional species along a gradient of trophic levels and habitats are
  considered in the context of the recognized high degree of spatial variability in
  bioaccumulation across the Everglades.
