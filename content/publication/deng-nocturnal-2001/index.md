abstract: Many birds move at night, and although there is strong potential for collisions
  with stationary structures, the behavior of birds in response to such structures
  is poorly understood. We studied the nocturnal interactions of waterbirds with a
  550v transmission powerline in the flat, open landscape of the Florida Everglades
  using a combination of surveillance radar to detect incoming birds, and night vision
  optical equipment to observe flight behavior. During 118 hours of observation we
  recorded a total of 285 flocks of ciconiiform birds crossing the powerline during
  spring 1997. We visually observed 663 birds in 187 flocks, and documented their
  response to the powerline. We found that the flight directions and the colony site
  locality strongly suggested regular nocturnal foraging behavior of some species,
  especially Black-crowned Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Wood Storks (Mycteria
  americana). Birds flying at night were less likely to react to the powerline, suggesting
  that powerlines may pose more of a collision threat during darkness. However, we
  also found that waterbirds flew higher at night than during the day and thus came
  into a zone of potential contact with the powerline much less often than during
  the day.
