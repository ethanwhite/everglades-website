abstract: We describe a 9 m2 drop net and removable walkways designed to quantify
  densities of small fishes in wetland habitats with low to moderate vegetation density.
  The method permits the collection of small, quantitative, discrete samples in ecologically
  sensitive areas by combining rapid net deployment from fixed sites with the carefully
  contained use of the fish toxicant rotenone. This method requires very little contact
  with the substrate, causes minimal alteration to the habitat being sampled, samples
  small fishes in an unbiased manner, and allows for differential sampling of microhabitats
  within a wetland. When used in dwarf red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) habitat in
  southern Everglades National Park and adjacent areas (September 1990 to March 1993),
  we achieved high recovery efficiencies (78â€“90%) for five common species textless110
  mm in length. We captured 20,193 individuals of 26 species. The most abundant fishes
  were sheepshead minnowCyprinodon variegatus, goldspotted killifishFloridichthys
  carpio, rainwater killifishLucania parva, sailfin mollyPoecilia latipinna, and the
  exotic Mayan cichlidCichlasoma urophthalmus. The 9 m2 drop net and associated removable
  walkways are versatile and can be used in a variety of wetland types, including
  both interior and coastal wetlands with either herbaceous or woody vegetation.
