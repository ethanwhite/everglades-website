abstract: Between March and June of 1994 and 1995, mercury (Hg) concentrations were
  determined from 393 blood and 164 growing scapular feathers from 252 great egret
  nestlings (Ardea albus). Nestlings came from eight colonies located in Water Conservation
  Area 3 in the Everglades region in southern Florida. The ages of these birds ranged
  from 1 to 44 d (bill length 1.1 to 10.2 cm). Mercury concentrations in blood and
  feathers of first-hatched great egret nestlings sampled during 1994 averaged 1.2
  μg/g (range = 0.07–3.9) wet weight and 16 μg/g (4.5–40) dry weight, respectively.
  During 1995, first-hatched chicks had blood and feather Hg concentrations that averaged
  0.8 μg/g (0.2–1.7) and 9.7 μg/g (2.3–26), respectively. In both years, Hg concentrations
  in blood and feathers were significantly correlated, and a significant correlation
  also was found between Hg in blood and age of the chicks. Blood and feather Hg concentrations
  differed significantly between years, with higher concentrations during 1994. Birds
  from JW1 and L67 colonies had the highest concentrations of Hg in blood and feathers.
  Mercury concentrations did not differ between chicks of different hatch order. Mercury
  in feathers of great egret nestlings from southern Florida are approximately six
  times higher when compared to feather Hg concentrations of nestling wading birds
  sampled elsewhere.
