abstract: Ecological facilitation (mutualism and commensalism) appears to be a strong
  force shaping biotic communities, and may be more likely in stressful and dynamic
  environments like wetlands. We examined a specific type of mutualism, ‘protective
  nesting associations,’ between herons and egrets (Ardeidae) and American alligators
  (Alligator mississippiensis). We predicted that wading birds would be attracted
  to sites with alligators. A survey of potential nesting sites in the Everglades
  showed strong nonrandom association, with wading birds never nesting without alligators.
  At previously unoccupied nesting colony sites, we experimentally manipulated apparent
  densities of alligators and birds using alligator and bird decoys. Small day-herons
  (little blue herons (Egretta caerulea), tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), and
  snowy egrets (Egretta thula)) were significantly more numerous at sites with both
  alligator and bird decoys than other treatments. These findings together support
  the hypothesis that wading birds actively choose predator-protected nesting locations
  based in part on information from both conspecifics and alligators, and suggest
  that the mechanism supporting this habitat choice is primarily due to nest protection
  benefits the alligators inadvertently provide. We propose that this interaction
  is strong and could be geographically widespread, and suggest that it may be critical
  to shaping management and conservation of wetland function.
