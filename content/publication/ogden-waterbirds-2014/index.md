abstract: The coastal marine environment is currently under threat from many anthropogenic
  pressures that were identified by the MARES project. Indicators of ecosystem health
  are needed so that targets can be set to guide protection and restoration efforts.
  Species of birds that are dependent on coastal habitats are ubiquitous along the
  coasts of southern Florida. Generally referred to as waterbirds, these species,
  although not all taxonomically related, share a common dependency on the marine
  environment for food, nesting habitat, or both. A suite of waterbirds was selected
  based on their perceived sensitivity to pressures in multiple coastal habitat types.
  The list of species was refined on the basis of a review of life history for characteristics
  that might make the species particularly vulnerable. Each selected species was then
  evaluated for sensitivity to the identified pressures using a hierarchical assessment
  that took into account the sensitivity, severity, and the temporal and spatial scales
  of the indicator to the given pressures. The selected suite of indicators was collectively
  sensitive to all the pressures except one.
