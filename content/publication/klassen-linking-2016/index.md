abstract: Establishing a link between food availability and productivity is often
  central to the recovery of declining populations; however, differences in prey selection
  may influence how populations are affected by changes in prey availability. We determined
  prey selection and prey availability for 3 wading bird species, and investigated
  the effects of prey availability on the number of nests initiated by 6 wading bird
  species in the Florida Everglades, USA. To determine prey selection, we compared
  food items recovered from tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), snowy egret (Egretta
  thula), and little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) nestlings to aquatic prey availability
  from throw-traps across the Everglades landscape from 2012 to 2014. Tricolored heron
  and snowy egret prey composition was statistically similar across years, with the
  majority of prey biomass coming from relatively large (textgreater1.9 cm) marsh
  fish. Little blue heron prey composition differed from the other wading bird species,
  and contained a higher percentage of grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) and exotic
  fish species. Numbers of small heron nests were positively influenced by the availability
  of large marsh fish across the landscape, whereas numbers of nests for other wading
  bird species (wood stork [Mycteria americana], great egret [Ardea alba], white ibis
  [Eudocimus albus]) were not. Our results suggest differences among wading bird species
  in their prey selection and availability. Although small heron foraging may seem
  restricted by their specialization on marsh fishes, their short nesting cycles allow
  for the phenological flexibility to delay nesting until foraging conditions are
  optimal. Conversely, wood storks with longer nesting cycles are more temporally
  constrained but have greater flexibility in prey items and foraging range. The annual
  number of small heron nests may be more robust to hydrological variability as a
  result of management action or global change than the number of wood stork nests.
  The temporal constraints of nesting by wood storks indicate that management of supporting
  wetland systems should provide continuous habitat availability during the nesting
  season. Â© 2016 The Wildlife Society.
