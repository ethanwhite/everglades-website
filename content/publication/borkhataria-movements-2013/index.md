abstract: Activity patterns of fledgling storks (Ciconiidae) during the parental-dependency
  period are poorly understood for many species, including the Wood Stork (Mycteria
  americana). Satellite telemetry was used to track the movements of fledgling Wood
  Storks ( n = 50) from the time they attained minimum flight capabilities until dispersal
  from the natal colony. Distances traveled, range size, and habitat use by fledgling
  Wood Storks were quantified for early (prior to the final week before dispersal)
  and late (the final week before dispersal) predispersal periods and for the entire
  predis-persal period as a whole. Metrics were compared among three colonies and
  between two years at a single colony using nonparametric tests. For the entire predispersal
  period, the mean daily maximum distance of juvenile Wood Storks from their nest
  was 1.39 ± 0.2 km (median = 0.18 and maximum = 103.13) and the mean cumulative distance
  moved per day was 2.38 ± 0.28 km (median = 0.45 and maximum = 110.58). Movement
  distances differed among colonies and between years, while core and total ranges
  were similar regardless of location. The majority of locations (84%) occurred within
  colony boundaries, 95% occurred within 1.0 km of the colony and 98% occurred within
  3.5 km of the colony. Flight distances did not increase linearly with time and instead
  followed a Poisson distribution, increasing sharply during the final week before
  dispersal. Habitat management recommendations for juvenile Wood Storks are to preserve
  wetland features within a 1.0–3.5 km zone around a colony.
