abstract: 'To test the hypothesis that fledging wading birds would be more at risk
  from mercury toxicosis than younger nestlings, captive great egret nestlings were
  maintained as controls or were dosed from 1- to 14-wk-old with 0.5 or 5 mg methylmercury
  chloride/kg wet weight in fish. Birds dosed with 5 mg/kg suffered from subacute
  toxicosis at wk 10â€“12. Growing feather concentrations were the most closely correlated
  with cumulative mercury consumed per weight. Blood concentrations of mercury increased
  more rapidly after 9 wk in all groups when feathers stopped growing. Total mercury
  accumulated in tissues in concentrations in the following order: growing scapular
  feathers &gt; powderdown &gt; mature scapular feathers &gt; liver &gt; kidney &gt;
  blood &gt; muscle &gt; pancreas &gt; brain &gt; bile &gt; fat &gt; eye. The proportion
  of total mercury that was methylated depended upon tissue type and dose group. Selenium
  accumulated in liver in direct proportion to liver mercury concentrations. After
  wk 9, appetite and weight index (weight/bill length) declined significantly in both
  dosed groups. At current exposure levels in the Everglades (Florida, USA) mercury
  deposited in rapidly growing feathers may protect nestlings from adverse effects
  on growth until feathers cease growing.'
