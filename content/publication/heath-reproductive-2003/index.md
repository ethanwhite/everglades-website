abstract: 'We measured plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, progesterone,
  and corticosterone; and recorded changes in gonad size, body condition, molt, and
  brood patch development of free-living adult White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) during
  the breeding season in the Florida Everglades. White Ibises are colonially breeding,
  long-legged wading birds that inhabit freshwater and estuarine wetlands. They have
  flexible breeding schedules (nest initiation dates can range from January to September)
  and onset of nesting is usually associated with increased prey availability caused
  by concentration of small fish in pools during periods of wetland drying. In this
  paper, we present the hormonal and physical characteristics of White Ibis reproductive
  physiology. We classified White Ibis breeding into five stages: pre-breeding, display,
  copulation/egg production, incubation, and chick rearing. White Ibises showed cyclic
  gonadal development which corresponded to reproductive stage. Male and female testosterone
  concentrations increased during the display stage and decreased during copulation,
  incubation, and chick rearing. Female estradiol concentrations were highest during
  display and chick rearing and male estradiol concentrations were lowest during copulation.
  Female progesterone concentrations increased during display and remained high throughout
  the breeding season. Female ibises had low corticosterone concentrations that increased
  during incubation and were highest during chick rearing, concomitant with lower
  body condition and flight muscle-mass scores. Male ibis progesterone and corticosterone
  concentrations did not show seasonal changes and were more variable than concentrations
  in female ibises at similar stages. Males and females had elevated body condition
  scores during the display stage, which were depleted by the onset of incubation.
  Increased energy stores during display may be used later for fasting in male birds
  that do not eat during the 10-day copulation/egg production stage, and for egg production
  in female birds. During incubation, male and female ibises developed brood patches.
  Ibises molted in all stages of reproduction, indicating that ibis molt and reproductive
  physiology may not inhibit each other as in most temperate bird species. White Ibises
  showed similar patterns in reproductive physiology to other monogamous, seasonally
  breeding bird species in which both sexes incubate and care for the young.'
