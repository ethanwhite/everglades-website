abstract: Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) breed in colonies widely dispersed across
  approximately 3,350 km2 within the United States, and effective monitoring of this
  population presents immediate tradeoffs between coverage, accuracy, and cost. Here,
  we summarize surveys in Florida 1991-2005 as a first step towards improving existing
  survey strategies. In order to determine whether counts from aircraft are a suitable
  technique for quantifying nests, we compared aerial and ground counts at the same
  eleven colonies in 2004. Across all colonies, aerial counts averaged 8.1% more nests,
  probably as result of either better visibility or mistakenly including Great Egret
  (Ardea alba) nests in the count. During the period 1991-2005, statewide totals in
  Florida ranged from 2,211-6,449 nests, with an apparently increasing trend through
  time. Annual modal colony size fluctuated from 65-144 nests, with significantly
  smaller modal size in 2001-2004, suggesting that colony size has decreased over
  time. Current survey practices are to visit all previously active colonies and all
  new ones that are reported or that are encountered during flights between known
  colonies. Surveys are not systematic, and the number or importance of novel, undetected
  colonies is unknown. In south Florida, where past and potential colony sites have
  been systematically surveyed annually, turnover (proportion of colony sites different
  in two surveys) increased rapidly with interval between surveys, and within 10 years,
  textgreater80% of colony sites differed. Annual turnover rates were not uniform
  across years, and young colonies appeared to have higher turnover than older ones
  (up to 4 years). Novel systematic aerial transects across suitable habitat in central
  Florida revealed approximately one novel colony/525 km2. Thus, abandonment of old
  colonies and formation of new ones is a typical and fairly rapid process in this
  species. Throughout the state, larger colonies were more persistent, and were surveyed
  more often than small colonies. The bias of the current nonsystematic survey strategy
  is towards visiting older colonies that are likely to disappear within 15 years,
  and against finding newer, growing colonies. This is likely to bias estimates of
  total population downwards compared to true values. We strongly recommend that surveys
  be geographically systematic, even if this reduces coverage. We suggest these systematic
  surveys be located in large blocks (hundreds or even thousands of km2) in areas
  with suitable habitat and historically high colony densities.
