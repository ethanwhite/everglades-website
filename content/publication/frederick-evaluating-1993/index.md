abstract: Measurement of survival in nestling ciconiiforms is difficult due to dense
  vegetation, cryptically plumaged young, and unpredictable movements of mobile nestlings
  in treetops. Thus, we used posturesensing radio transmitters to measure survival
  of nestling tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) during the 40- to 50-day period
  when young are mobile in the colony but dependent upon parental feedings; we used
  the known survival of birds marked with radio transmitters to assess the use of
  other techniques to estimate survival. We found nestling mortality rates nearly
  3 times as high in the post-mobile stage as during the pre-mobile stage. Nestling
  censuses that used unique color-band combinations along a marked nest transect became
  unreliable after 21 days of age. Similarly, censuses of young in congregation and
  loafing areas within the colony resulted in large underestimates of nestling survival.
  Poor detectability of carcasses on transect walks (33-50%) precluded use of carcass
  counts to estimate chick mortality directly. We conclude that telemetry is probably
  the only reliable method for the accurate measurement of nestling survival in most
  colony situations.
