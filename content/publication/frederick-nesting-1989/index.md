abstract: In 1986 and 1987, we studied the nesting success of five species of wading
  birds (Ciconiiformes) through repeated visits to a total of 1,609 marked nests in
  18 colonies in the Florida Everglades. Abandonment was the most common cause of
  nesting failure for all species and usually occurred following heavy rainfall and
  periods of rising surface water. Using stepwise logistic regression, we found that
  rapid surface water drying rate was associated most strongly with White Ibis (Eudocimus
  albus) nesting success, and that amount of rainfall was directly associated with
  failure of Great Egret (Casmerodius alba) nests. From records of 32 past surveys
  of White Ibis nesting numbers in two different water management areas, we found
  that years with high nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates
  than years with low nesting numbers. There was no significant difference in amount
  of spring rainfall, autumn/winter drying rate, or water depth. Abandonments by ibises
  appeared to be closely related to prey densities, which probably were directly affected
  by water-level fluctuations.
