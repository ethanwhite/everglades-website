abstract: We compiled published and unpublished records of large nestings of White
  Ibises (Eudocimus albus) in the United States between 1930 and 1993. The resulting
  database provides evidence of at least four major geographic shifts of the breeding
  population of White Ibises during the period. Banding returns and colony histories
  demonstrate that the movements were not migratory. The extremely fast growth of
  most White Ibis breeding colonies indicates that local recruitment could not have
  fueled the large increases in breeding numbers in colonized areas. Ibises seem to
  colonize wetland areas that have good feeding resources and to abandon areas that
  lose the ability to supply this resource. Mechanisms of attraction to new sites
  and repulsion from degraded ones may work alone or in tandem. Degradation of breeding
  sites frequently occurs through natural processes, such as hurricanes, stochastic
  weather patterns, and wetland conditions, and the nomadic behavior of White Ibises
  appears to be an obligate life-history feature. Although surveys throughout the
  range of the U.S. population of White Ibises have never been comprehensive, available
  records indicate minimum breeding populations of 125,000 pairs in 1933, 170,000
  pairs in 1976, and 51,000 pairs in 1991. The U.S. population as a whole appears
  to be decreasing. White Ibises share a suite of population, social, and movement
  characteristics with a number of nomadic species. Conservation strategies for these
  species may differ fundamentally from those targeting more sedentary species. Nomadic
  species may typically depend on large populations to find food and to stimulate
  breeding and are therefore likely to decline abruptly and unpredictably as habitat
  is lost or degraded. Rapid population declines may occur at population levels well
  above those predicted by genetic and minimum viability models. Because of its nomadic
  habit, the survival of this species may depend on a regional planning approach.
  To conserve this species we recommend a continuing commitment to the monitoring,
  assessment, and preservation of a mosaic of fresh and estuarine wetlands in the
  southeastern U.S.; the maintenance of natural disturbances needed to produce pulses
  of food in these wetlands, and the coordination of management efforts throughout
  the US., as well as between the U.S. and Cuba.
