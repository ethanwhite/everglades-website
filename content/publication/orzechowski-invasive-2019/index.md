abstract: Invasive Burmese pythons have been shown to have population-level effects
  on native mammals in southern Florida. Tens of thousands of long-legged wading birds
  (of multiple species in Ciconiiformes, Pelecaniformes) breed in aggregations, known
  as colonies, on tree islands in the Everglades. Burmese pythons may pose a threat
  to these colonies because pythons are semi-aquatic and commonly use tree islands
  and arboreal habitat. However, python predation on nests of wading birds has not
  previously been documented or quantified. We used trail cameras to monitor nests
  at colonies in Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Area 3 in 2014, and
  2016–2017. We did not detect Burmese python predation at monitored nests in 2014
  (23 nests in 2 colonies) or 2016 (59 nests in 4 colonies). In 2017 (125 nests in
  7 colonies), we detected three individual pythons consuming nestlings, fledglings,
  and eggs in a minimum of 7.9% (5 nests, n = 63) of monitored nests at a colony in
  Everglades National Park. In 2017, the overall predation rate of Burmese pythons
  at all monitored nests (5 of 125 nests, or 4%), was five times the native predator
  rate (1 of 125 nests, or 0.8%). Our study confirms that Burmese pythons are acting
  as predators in wading bird colonies at nontrivial rates and provides a baseline
  to which future studies can refer.
