abstract: During the late 1980s, the upper trophic-level biota of the Everglades (FL,
  USA) was recognized as being highly contaminated with mercury (Hg). However, the
  timing and pattern of that increase is poorly known, and no information is available
  about mercury contam ination in Everglades wildlife prior to 1974. We measured methylmercury
  concentrations in feathers of white ibises (n = 33), great egrets (n = 7), anhingas
  (n = 21), and great blue herons (n = 12) from museum specimens collected from 1910
  through 1980 and combined them with more recent feather samples collected from live
  birds (1985–2000, n = 98, 37, 49, and 7, respectively). We found no evidence of
  contamination of museum samples with inorganic mercuric preservatives (0.01–0.28%
  of total Hg in feathers). All species showed relatively low concentrations of mercury
  through the 1970s (textless5 μl/L dry wt for anhingas, ibises, and egrets, textless10
  μl/L for herons). Samples from all species taken during the 1990s showed a large
  and significant increase (4–5X) in MeHg concentration. This evidence suggests that
  most of the increase in Hg deposition during the 20th century in south Florida occurred
  during the last two to three decades, which is consistent with information about
  local source deposition. Contamination levels prior to the 1970s appear to have
  been associated with normal reproduction in these birds, suggesting partial evidence
  for a threshold of reproductive impairment.
