abstract: The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is now established as a breeding
  population throughout south Florida, USA. However, the extent of the invasion, and
  the ecological impacts of this novel apex predator on animal communities are incompletely
  known, in large part because Burmese pythons (hereafter “pythons”) are extremely
  cryptic and there has been no efficient way to detect them. Pythons are recently
  confirmed nest predators of long-legged wading bird breeding colonies (orders Ciconiiformes
  and Pelecaniformes). Pythons can consume large quantities of prey and may not be
  recognized as predators by wading birds, therefore they could be a particular threat
  to colonies. To quantify python occupancy rates at tree islands where wading birds
  breed, we utilized environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis—a genetic tool which detects
  shed DNA in water samples and provides high detection probabilities. We fitted multi-scale
  Bayesian occupancy models to test the prediction that pythons occupy islands with
  wading bird colonies at higher rates compared to representative control islands
  containing no breeding birds. Our results suggest that pythons are widely distributed
  across the central Everglades in proximity to active wading bird colonies. In support
  of our prediction that pythons are attracted to colonies, site-level python eDNA
  occupancy rates were higher at wading bird colonies (ψ = 0.88, 95% credible interval
  [0.59–1.00]) than at the control islands (ψ = 0.42 [0.16–0.80]) in April through
  June (n = 15 colony-control pairs). We found our water temperature proxy (time of
  day) to be informative of detection probability, in accordance with other studies
  demonstrating an effect of temperature on eDNA degradation in occupied samples.
  Individual sample concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 38.29 copies/μL and we generally
  detected higher concentrations of python eDNA in colony sites. Continued monitoring
  of wading bird colonies is warranted to determine the effect pythons are having
  on populations and investigate putative management activities.
