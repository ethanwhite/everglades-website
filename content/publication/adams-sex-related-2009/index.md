abstract: During a time of food stress, we observed sex-biased mortality during the
  nestling stage in a sexually size dimorphic species of wading bird, the White Ibis
  (Eudocimus albus). Over four days spread out over a week, we captured a total of
  180 25-32 d old White Ibis nestlings from a colony of several thousand breeding
  pairs. On sequential capture dates we caught significantly fewer females than males.
  Through this time period male nestlings had higher body condition indices (mass/tarsus)
  than females, though the rates at which male and female body condition increased
  over the week were not significantly different. Several sources of evidence suggest
  that our sampling was not sex-biased and was reflective of actual changes in abundance
  of males and females. These data indicate that despite the greater caloric requirements
  of males, their larger size may have conferred a competitive advantage over female
  siblings in obtaining food from parents during a time of food shortage.
