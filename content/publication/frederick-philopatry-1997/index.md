abstract: We compare long-term movement behavior, breeding site philopatry, population
  dynamics and prey choice of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) and Wood Storks (Mycteria
  americana) in order to illustrate (1) differences in strategies for exploiting spatially
  and temporally unpredictable food resources in wetlands of the southeastern U.S.,
  and (2) the temporal and geographic scale at which conservation strategies for these
  species must be targeted. Since the 1930s, the U.S. White Ibis population has made
  a series of long-range (textgreater400 km) shifts in the center of its breeding
  range. Very large colonies seem to exist for less than 15 years, and to be supported
  by at least 800 km$^textrm2$ of wetlands. Movements may be prompted either by degrading
  breeding conditions caused by both man-made and natural disturbances, or by attraction
  to abnormally high concentrations of prey. Wood Storks have also undergone large
  scale shifts in the center of breeding, but are much more philopatric to breeding
  sites (often textgreater25 yr). They may be locally buffered from the unpredictability
  of food resources by the ability to forage at large distances from their colonies,
  and by being associated with more permanent wetlands. Preservation of specific colony
  sites and associated wetlands may well aid in conserving Wood Stork populations.
  In contrast, nomadic ibises require a different conservation approach, one that
  protects a geographically widespread network of wetland ecosystems.
