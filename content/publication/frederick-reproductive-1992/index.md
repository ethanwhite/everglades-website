abstract: We compared numbers of nesting pairs, clutch size, nest success, and production
  of young of Tricolored Herons (Egretta tricolor), Little Blue Herons (E. caerulea)
  and Snowy Egrets (E. thula) breeding in freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats
  of southern Florida between 1986 and 1989. Tricolored Herons were commonest in marine
  habitats, while Snowy Egrets and Little Blue Herons were most common in estuarine
  and freshwater habitats, respectively. Among Tricolored Herons, we found no evidence
  for consistent differences in laying date among the three habitats, and no relationship
  between clutch size and laying date. Among Tricolored Herons and Snowy Egrets, clutch
  sizes were larger in freshwater areas than in either of the two saline habitats,
  with no consistent differences in clutch size between marine and estuarine locations.
  Survival of nests was consistently higher in freshwater and marine than in estuarine
  habitat, an effect largely attributable to heavy egg predation by Common Crows (Corvus
  brachyrhynchos) in estuarine colonies during incubation. Fledging success of Snowy
  Egrets and Tricolored Herons also was consistently higher in freshwater habitats
  than in either of the saline habitats. Thus, freshwater habitats showed generally
  increased nesting success and productivity over saline ones. Potential explanations
  for these differences among habitats include increased nest predation in estuarine
  colonies, a degrading estuarine and marine food web in the region, and the energetic
  constraints of salt excretion.
