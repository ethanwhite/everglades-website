abstract: Methylmercury is a globally distributed neurotoxin, endocrine disruptor,
  and teratogen, the effects of which on wildlife at environmentally relevant levels
  are largely unknown. In birds, foraging efficiency and learning may be sensitive
  endpoints for sublethal methylmercury toxicity, and these endpoints also may be
  biologically relevant at the population level. In the present study, groups of wild-caught,
  prefledgling white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were raised in a free-flight, open-air
  aviary on diets that approximated the measured range of methylmercury exposure in
  the Everglades ecosystem (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/d). The effect of methylmercury
  exposure on group foraging efficiency was examined by allowing birds to forage on
  200 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in artificial ponds for 15 min by straining
  the arenas' contents through a seine net and counting all remaining prey. Additionally,
  we varied the difficulty of foraging by these tactile feeding birds by adding multiple
  levels of structural complexity (e.g., increased vegetation and prey refugia) to
  the pond. Structural complexity affected both foraging efficiency and the rate of
  increase in efficiency over time (improvement). Methylmercury exposure affected
  foraging efficiency (p = 0.03). It did not affect foraging improvement in the face
  of increasingly challenging environments, however, and the dose-response relationship
  was nonlinear (e.g., the control and high-exposure groups were the least efficient
  foragers). Evidence for an effect of methylmercury on foraging efficiency therefore
  was inconclusive because of unpredicted results and no interaction with time or
  habitat complexity. These data suggest a nonlinear dose-response relationship at
  low levels of methylmercury exposure; future research is needed to verify this hypothesis.
  This appears to be the first experimental demonstration of the effects of habitat
  complexity on foraging efficiency in long-legged wading birds.
