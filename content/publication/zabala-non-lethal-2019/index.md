abstract: Mercury is a global contaminant with special relevance for aquatic food
  webs, where biomagnification can result in strong effects on apex predators. Non-lethal
  sampling of tissues such as blood and feathers is often used to assess mercury risk
  and spatiotemporal variability of mercury exposure on avian populations. However,
  the assumption that samples from individuals within a population are representative
  of local mercury exposure underpins those approaches. While this assumption may
  be justified, it is rarely expressed quantitatively. Further, the stability of the
  tissue/exposure relationship over time or space may depend on the sampling medium
  used, since some tissues and age classes may be better at reflecting local or short-term
  changes in exposure. Here, we present analyses of mercury concentrations from three
  tissues (albumen, blood and feathers) of the same individual great egret (Ardea
  alba) nestlings from breeding colonies in the Florida Everglades collected over
  three consecutive years. The interaction of year and colony location explained at
  least 50% of the observed variation in mercury concentration in all the sampled
  tissues. Annual colony-wide average Hg concentrations in any of the sampled tissues
  correlated with average Hg concentrations in the other two tissues from the same
  colony (R2 textgreater 0.53 in every case), while concentrations in albumen, blood
  and feathers from the same individual correlated poorly (R2 textless 0.23 in every
  case). We suggest that despite high variation between and within individuals of
  the same colony, annual colony-averaged mercury concentrations in albumen, nestling
  blood or feathers can be representative indicators of annual geographic differences
  in mercury exposure. These results support the use of non-lethal sampling of nestling
  tissues to reflect local mercury exposure over large spatial scales.
