abstract: This report documents breeding numbers, reproductive success, and foragingdispersion
  of long-legged wading birds in the Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) of theEverglades
  during the first six months of 1993. Briefly, the 1993 spring had abnormallyhigh
  water and windy conditions throughout the season, and produced poor nesting effort,low
  to moderate nesting success, and low production of young. Some species, like WoodStorks
  and White Ibises, did not nest at all in the WCAs. Others, like Great Egrets andTricolored
  Herons, showed considerably tenacity under the extremely poor nestingconditions.
  The 1993 season provided a rare chance to record the reproductive responses ofwading
  birds during sustained high water conditions. (108 page document)
