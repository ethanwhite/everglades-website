  420Estuarine resource managers need reliable information about the state of the
  ecosystem and how it is changing over time due to natural or anthropogenic perturbations.
  Animal indicators are often used for this purpose, as they are highly visible, reactive,
  easily measured, and of intuitive value to the wider public (Morrison, 1986; Landres
  et al., 1988; Kushlan, 1993; Frederick and Ogden, 2003). Various attributes of animal
  populations or communities (e.g., population size, reproductive success, habitat
  use, species composition) may provide information about other ecosystem attributes
  that are more difficult to measure (e.g., trophic structure, hydrology, contamination).
  When one or a small number of species are used to provide information about other
  members or attributes of an ecosystem, they are referred to as “surrogate species”
  (Caro and O’Doherty, 1999). The role of surrogate species may fall into one of the
  following categories: health indicator, biodiversity indicator, umbrella species,
  keystone species, or flagship species. There is much literature on the use of surrogate
  species; Table 26.1 provides definitions of terms commonly used when referring to
  vertebrate indicator species, and Table 26.2 lists attributes that must be considered
  when choosing an appropriate indicator species within a specific ecological system.'
