abstract: We measured the behavioral effects of methylmercury on 16 great egret chicks
  (Ardea albus) in a captive dosing experiment. Birds were randomly divided into a
  control group and groups that received 0.5 or 5 mg methylmercury chloride per kilogram
  of food at between 12 and 105 d of age. We recorded activity levels, maintenance
  behavior, and foraging efficiency and determined that mercury affected activity
  and maintenance behavior. Birds dosed with 5 mg/kg became severely ataxic and were
  euthanized by 12 weeks of age. We found that, during the postfledging period, there
  were no differences between low-dose and placebo birds in time required to capture
  live fish in pools or in efficiency of capture. We did find that low-dose birds
  were less likely to hunt fish. Our results suggest that, at the 0.5 mg/kg concentration
  in food, there are significant effects of methylmercury on activity, tendency to
  seek shade, and motivation to hunt prey.
