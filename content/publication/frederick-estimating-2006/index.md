abstract: Counts of nest starts are often used as indicators of the size of avian
  nesting populations, or of avian productivity. However, the accuracy of single or
  repeated counts of unmarked nests over time for estimating seasonal numbers of nests
  may be strongly affected by nest events that fall in between survey dates, or that
  occurred prior to or after the survey period. Accuracy may also be affected by uncertainty
  in the interpretation of counts due to overlap between starting and ending dates
  of asynchronous nests during the intervisit interval. To measure the combined magnitude
  of these effects on survey accuracy, we overlaid a monthly “survey” regime on known
  initiation and ending dates of 2055 nests of ciconiiform birds. Assuming all nests
  present on the date of simulated survey were counted, monthly surveys underestimated
  the true number of nest starts by 24–64%, depending on species and year. Using a
  simple model, we also demonstrate that accuracy does not increase much as survey
  frequency increases, and that significant estimation error can occur over a wide
  range of nest success values and degrees of asynchrony. We suggest that (1) these
  biases can be significant for surveys of many kinds of nesting birds including some
  territorial passerines, (2) this bias cannot be addressed by increasing survey frequency,
  and (3) the degree of renesting may be of critical interest for inferring breeding
  population size from nest count data. We suggest three possible approaches for modeling
  this error.
