abstract: We modeled population dynamics and extinction probabilities for the endangered
  Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) using count data from synoptic aerial surveys, annual
  measures of productivity from throughout the southeastern U.S., and survival data
  from satellite-tagged juveniles. Using a simple, count-based diffusion approximation
  approach we were able to quantify an increasing population trend since 1976. High
  inter-year variability resulted in wide confidence intervals and we could not eliminate
  the possibility of long-term population decline in spite of recently measured population
  increases. We also used a stage-based population matrix model to incorporate observed
  differences in survival rates among age classes. Fledging success, and survival
  of fledglings, one, and two-year-old birds were estimated using data from the satellite
  telemetry study. Because the survival rates of three-year-olds and adults are presently
  unknown, we analyzed population dynamics over a range of these values. Long-term
  population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship. This deterministic
  matrix model indicated that adult survival rates textgreater0.94 were necessary
  to maintain a growing population, an estimate considerably higher than that observed
  in the European White Stork (Ciconia ciconia). This study underscores the need for
  reliable estimates of juvenile and adult survival in Wood Storks, and for a conservation
  focus on the factors that affect adult survival. It also provides a tool for understanding
  and projecting potential trajectories of the Wood Stork population in the Southeastern
  United States.
