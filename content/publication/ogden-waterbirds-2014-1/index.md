abstract: In our companion manuscript we identified 11 waterbirds as indicators of
  various pressures on the coastal marine ecosystems of southern Florida. Here, we
  identify the habitats on which these species depend and the ecological linkages
  that make them representative of those habitats. Through the use of conceptual ecological
  models (CEMs), we develop tools that can be used by managers/decision makers to
  evaluate the health of the various habitats in order to rectify myriad problems
  that are occurring or will possibly occur in the future such that the valuable ecosystem
  services provided by these habitats can be maximized. We also demonstrate the practical
  use of these tools by documenting data availability, benchmarks, and scientific
  needs for each species.
