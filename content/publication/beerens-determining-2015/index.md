abstract: "Determining habitat quality for wildlife populations requires relating\
  \ a species' habitat to its survival and reproduction. Within a season, species\
  \ occurrence and density can be disconnected from measures of habitat quality when\
  \ resources are highly seasonal, unpredictable over time, and patchy. Here we establish\
  \ an explicit link among dynamic selection of changing resources, spatio-temporal\
  \ species distributions, and fitness for predictive abundance and occurrence models\
  \ that are used for short-term water management and long-term restoration planning.\
  \ We used the wading bird distribution and evaluation models (WADEM) that estimate\
  \ (1) daily changes in selection across resource gradients, (2) landscape abundance\
  \ of flocks and individuals, (3) conspecific foraging aggregation, and (4) resource\
  \ unit occurrence (at fixed 400 m cells) to quantify habitat quality and its consequences\
  \ on reproduction for wetland indicator species. We linked maximum annual numbers\
  \ of nests detected across the study area and nesting success of Great Egrets (Ardea\
  \ alba), White Ibises (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) over\
  \ a 20-year period to estimated daily dynamics of food resources produced by WADEM\
  \ over a 7490 km2 area. For all species, increases in predicted species abundance\
  \ in March and high abundance in April were strongly linked to breeding responses.\
  \ Great Egret nesting effort and success were higher when birds also showed greater\
  \ conspecific foraging aggregation. Synthesis and applications: This study provides\
  \ the first empirical evidence that dynamic habitat selection processes and distributions\
  \ of wading birds over environmental gradients are linked with reproductive measures\
  \ over periods of decades. Further, predictor variables at a variety of temporal\
  \ (daily-multiannual) resolutions and spatial (400 m to regional) scales effectively\
  \ explained variation in ecological processes that change habitat quality. The process\
  \ used here allows managers to develop short- and long-term conservation strategies\
  \ that (1) consider flexible behavioral patterns and (2) are robust to environmental\
  \ variation over time."
