abstract: Toxin emissions and legacies are major global issues affecting many species
  through, among other effects, endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment.
  Assessment of toxin risk to wildlife focuses mostly on offspring-related metrics,
  while the lack of breeding initiation or early breeding failure has received less
  attention. We tested whether exposure to methyl mercury (MeHg) results in early
  breeding failure and reduced number of breeding birds using observational and experimental
  data. We used 21 years of numbers of breeding pairs of colonially breeding wild
  Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in response to annual and geographical variation upon
  exposure to environmental MeHg. After controlling for food availability, we found
  a strong negative association between MeHg exposure and the number of breeding Great
  Egrets. We report reductions of textgreater50% in breeding numbers under exposure
  levels otherwise associated with textless20% reduction in post-egg-laying breeding
  success. Experimental exposure of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) to MeHg also caused
  early breeding failure and a âˆ¼20% reduction in breeding numbers at environmentally
  relevant exposures. The demographic consequences of reductions in breeding pairs
  are additive to known and typically studied impairments in postlaying reproductive
  success. Net demographic effects of exposure to endocrine disruptors may often be
  strongly underestimated if early breeding failure is not measured.
