abstract: Mercury, a common wetland pollutant, can affect wildlife populations through
  acute toxicity or through physiological effects that modify behavior and negatively
  influence reproductive success. We compared body-feather mercury concentrations
  of free-living male and female adult White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) during three
  breeding seasons in the Florida Everglades and examined the relationships among
  mercury, hormone concentrations, and body-condition scores. Female White Ibises
  consistently had lower mercury concentrations than males. Prebreeding females' estradiol
  concentrations were negatively correlated with mercury concentrations. However,
  we found no relationship between mercury and female testosterone, progesterone,
  and corticosterone concentrations. Incubating male White Ibises showed a significant
  positive relationship between testosterone and mercury concentrations, but no other
  significant hormonal correlations with mercury concentrations. We used a seven-year
  standardized data set of Great Egret (Ardea alba) chick-feather mercury concentrations
  as a measure of temporal changes in mercury bioavailability in the Everglades and
  related that measure to annual numbers of White Ibis nests. White Ibis nesting was
  negatively correlated with the mercury exposure index. Low numbers of nesting White
  Ibises may have been the result of fewer birds nesting or high abandonment rates.
  Our results suggest that mercury exposure may cause fewer birds to nest or more
  birds to abandon nests because of subacute effects on hormone systems. However,
  the results are correlative; they call for further investigation in free-living
  populations and in the laboratory.Relaciones entre las Concentraciones de Mercurio,
