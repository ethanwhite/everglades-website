abstract: Estimating detection error, as well as the magnitude of other potential
  survey biases, is essential when sampling efforts play a role in the estimation
  of population size and management of wildlife populations. We quantified visual
  biases in aerial surveys of nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) in colonies in
  the Florida Everglades using a negative binomial count regression model to compare
  numbers of nests in quadrats counted on the ground with numbers estimated from aerial
  photographs of the same quadrats. The model also allowed the determination of degree
  of difference between monitoring results based upon such factors as nest density,
  vegetative cover, and nest turnover rates. Aerial surveys of White Ibis (Eudocimus
  albus) colonies underestimated the true number of nests found during ground counts
  by 11.1%, and underestimates were significantly greater (P= 0.047) in a colony with
  high nest turnover. Error rates did not differ for quadrats that varied in the density
  of White Ibis nests did not differ, and visual bias did not increase with vegetative
  complexity (P= 0.73). Estimates of nest density in colonies of Great Egrets (Ardea
  alba) based on aerial surveys were higher than ground counts for 38% of the quadrats
  sampled, and mean visual bias was 23.1%. Species misidentification likely contributed
  to visibility bias for Great Egrets in our study, with some Snowy Egrets almost
  certainly mistaken for Great Egrets in aerial photos. Biases of the magnitude we
  observed fro Great Egrets and White Ibises can mask true population trends in long-term
  monitoring and, therefore, we recommend that detection probability be explicitly
  evaluated when conducting aerial surveys of nesting birds.
