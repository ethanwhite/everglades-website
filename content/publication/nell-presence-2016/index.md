abstract: Ecological associations where one species enhances habitat for another nearby
  species (facilitations) shape fundamental community dynamics and can promote niche
  expansion, thereby influencing how and where species persist and coexist. For the
  many breeding birds facing high nest-predation pressure, enemy-free space can be
  gained by nesting near more formidable animals for physical protection. While the
  benefits to protected species seem well documented, very few studies have explored
  whether and how protector species are affected by nest protection associations.
  Long-legged wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) actively choose nesting
  sites above resident American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), apparently
  to take advantage of the protection from mammalian nest predators that alligator
  presence offers. Previous research has shown that wading bird nesting colonies could
  provide substantial food for alligators in the form of dropped chicks. We compared
  alligator body condition in similar habitat with and without wading bird nesting
  colonies present. Alligator morphometric body condition indices were significantly
  higher in colony than in non-colony locations, an effect that was statistically
  independent of a range of environmental variables. Since colonially nesting birds
  and crocodilians co-occur in many tropical and subtropical wetlands, our results
  highlight a potentially widespread keystone process between two ecologically important
  species-groups. These findings suggest the interaction is highly beneficial for
  both groups of actors, and illustrate how selective pressures may have acted to
  form and reinforce a strongly positive ecological interaction.
