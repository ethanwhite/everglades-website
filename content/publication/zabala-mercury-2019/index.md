abstract: Piscivorous birds are at high risk of mercury exposure in aquatic food webs,
  and their reproductive success is sensitive to methylmercury exposure. Although
  effects are convincingly shown in a handful of lab studies, sublethal effects at
  environmentally relevant concentrations in the field, where there is a range of
  other natural stressors, are not well delineated. Part of that uncertainty arises
  because mercury concentration (hereafter, [Hg]) in adult tissues used to assess
  Hg risk can be influenced by Hg values in wintering grounds or other nonrelated
  areas. Several studies have used nestling tissues under the assumption that they
  better represent local risk to breeding since nestlings consume locally derived
  food. However, the correlation between [Hg] in nestling tissues and local breeding
  success remains unassessed. We analyzed great egret (Ardea alba) breeding parameters
  collected over 3 years (2015â€“2017) in the Everglades (Florida, USA). The Everglades
  is a large contiguous wetland with geographically dispersed wading bird breeding
  sites exposed to variable and biologically relevant ranges of mercury concentrations.
  We examined mercury concentrations in albumen and nestling blood and feathers as
  predictors of 6 measures of reproductive success at individual nests. Albumen [Hg]
  did not correlate with reproductive end points, and correlations with blood [Hg]
  were weak. Feather [Hg] correlated negatively with all of the posthatching endpoints
  and explained 8.3% of the variance in the probability of a laid egg resulting in
  a fledged chick. However, most of the observed failures were hatching failures,
  which were not explained by albumen [Hg], and other nestling tissues could therefore
  not be evaluated. While our results support the use of nestling feathers as indicators
  of site-specific mercury exposure, we discuss both advantages and possible limitations
  of using nestling feathers as indicators of local mercury exposure.
