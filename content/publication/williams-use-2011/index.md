abstract: Many populations of animals are fluid in both space and time, making estimation
  of numbers difficult. Much attention has been devoted to estimation of bias in detection
  of animals that are present at the time of survey. However, an equally important
  problem is estimation of population size when all animals are not present on all
  survey occasions. Here, we showcase use of the superpopulation approach to capture–recapture
  modeling for estimating populations where group membership is asynchronous, and
  where considerable overlap in group membership among sampling occasions may occur.
  We estimate total population size of long-legged wading bird (Great Egret and White
  Ibis) breeding colonies from aerial observations of individually identifiable nests
  at various times in the nesting season. Initiation and termination of nests were
  analogous to entry and departure from a population. Estimates using the superpopulation
  approach were 47–382% larger than peak aerial counts of the same colonies. Our results
  indicate that the use of the superpopulation approach to model nesting asynchrony
  provides a considerably less biased and more efficient estimate of nesting activity
  than traditional methods. We suggest that this approach may also be used to derive
  population estimates in a variety of situations where group membership is fluid.
