abstract: Over five seasons, I censused an estuarine colony of White Ibises (Eudocimus
  albus) in South Carolina using aerial counts before and after tidal washovers. I
  found 61% of all nesting starts were abandoned during these tides; since not all
  washovers were monitored, this figure is conservative. An analysis of tide gauge
  data indicates these destructive tides were frequent, and predictable across seasons.
  This colony is growing in size, and there is circumstantial evidence of breeding
  site fidelity despite the washovers. This is surprising, since White Ibises are
  known for frequent colony shifts. Although egg predation at this colony was comparatively
  low, and clutch size comparatively high, breeders still suffered far more total
  nest loss than at other coastal colonies. I suggest White Ibises do not use nesting
  failure, or predictability of failure as cues for abandonment, but rely on environmental
  cues such as local food availability and frequency of nest-site predation instead.
