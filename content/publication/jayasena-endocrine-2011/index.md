abstract: Methylmercury is a globally distributed pollutant and upper trophic level
  aquatic fauna are at particularly high risk of exposure. Although methylmercury
  is known to have a number of neurological and developmental effects, relatively
  little is known about effects on endocrine disruption and reproduction in aquatic
  fauna, particularly in response to chronic exposure at low concentrations. We experimentally
  exposed captive white ibises for 3.5 years (2005–2008) to dietary methylmercury
  at three environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.3ppm wet weight
  in diet). We measured fecal concentrations of estradiol and testosterone metabolites
  in two consecutive breeding seasons (2007 and 2008). When effects were controlled
  for stage of breeding, this resulted in altered estradiol and testosterone concentrations
  in adult breeders of both sexes. Changes in endocrine expression were not consistent
  over both years, and a clear dose–response relationship was not always present.
  Endocrine changes were, however, associated at all dose levels with changes in reproductive
  behavior, reduced reproductive success and altered mate choice in males. Male–male
  pairing and altered courtship behavior in males were related both to dose treatment
  and, in 2008, to a demasculinized pattern of endocrine expression. Changes in hormone
  concentrations of dosed homosexually paired males, when present, were in the same
  direction but at a higher magnitude than those in heterosexual dosed males. Dosed
  homosexual males showed decreased testosterone during nest-building and elevated
  testosterone during incubation when compared with their dosed heterosexual counterparts
  during the 2008 breeding season. In the same year, exposed males had elevated estradiol
  during courtship, but had decreased estradiol during other stages in comparison
  with controls. Dosed females generally showed decreased estradiol and testosterone
  concentrations compared to controls, albeit not with a clear dose–response effect.
  Our findings suggest that endocrine disruption due to chronic exposure to even low
  concentrations of dietary methylmercury may be a widespread mechanism by which reproduction
  is impaired in wild bird populations.
