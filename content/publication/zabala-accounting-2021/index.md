abstract: It remains unclear how sub-lethal effects of contaminants play out in relation
  to other stressors encountered by free-ranging populations. Effects may be masked
  or influenced by interactions with field stressors such as food availability. We
  predicted that (1) including food availability, and particularly its interaction
  with Hg, would reveal or enhance associations between Hg and breeding endpoints.
  We further predicted that (2) breeding impairment associated with Hg would be higher
  under food stress conditions. We monitored Hg and nest success of great egrets (Ardea
  alba) in eight breeding colonies in the Florida Everglades over 11 years. We characterized
  variation in local food availability among colonies and years using fish biomass
  and recession range –a proxy to fish vulnerability. We used two Hg exposure indicators
  (egg albumen Hg and nestling feather Hg) and six breeding endpoints (clutch-size,
  brood-size, fledged-size, hatching success, post-hatching success and fledglings
  per egg) to assess whether variation in food availability influenced associations
  between Hg and these endpoints. Accounting for interactions between Hg and food
  availability, we identified statistically significant associations in all 12 indicator-endpoint
  combinations, while only three were detectable without food. Further, 10 combinations
  showed interactions between Hg and components of food availability. Our results
  also indicated an endpoint-specific affinity, with albumen [Hg] explaining more
  variation in hatching success while nestling feather [Hg] explained more variation
  in post-hatching survival. Both Hg indicators accounted for relevant (6–10%) amounts
  of variation in fledglings produced per egg laid, an integrative endpoint. Increased
  Hg exposure resulted in overall reduced reproductive success when food availability
  was low, but our models predicted low or no effects of increasing Hg exposure when
  food availability was high. Our results indicate that Hg induced impairment is strongly
  driven by food availability, providing a framework that accommodates previously
  contradictory results in the literature.
