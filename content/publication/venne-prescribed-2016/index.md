abstract: Fire in uplands and wetlands results in a release of nutrients and increased
  light in the burned area. However, fire effects on aquatic community dynamics are
  not well understood. We hypothesized that the addition of light and nutrients resulting
  from prescribed burns in wetlands increases periphyton biomass and supports increased
  standing stock of marsh fishes. In the oligotrophic Everglades of Florida, USA,
  we conducted a 2 × 2 factorial experiment using prescribed burns over standing water
  (increased nutrients and light), mowing with removal of above-water vegetation (no
  nutrient increase), and shade houses (no light) to test the prediction that fire
  effects would lead to more periphyton biomass and greater abundance and size of
  fish compared to other treatments. We observed increased periphyton percent cover
  and biomass per area in response to fire treatments. Fish abundance showed a short-term
  increase in burned plots. Fish length, mass, and condition factor did not respond
  consistently to treatments, though some species responded to specific treatments.
  Wildfires in dry marshes that may combust organic soils and vegetation may impact
  wetlands more than prescribed burns in flooded marshes. Our study suggests that
  wetland fires can affect aquatic animal and plant community structure, at least
  for short periods post-fire.
