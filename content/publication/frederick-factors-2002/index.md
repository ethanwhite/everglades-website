abstract: This comprehensive final report summarizes the results of a four-year researchand
  monitoring effort (1998 - 2001) designed to document nesting effort and success
  bywading birds, and to investigate the reproductive physiology and ecology of White
  Ibises(Eudocimus albus) in the Everglades ecosystem. The monitoring of nesting has
  beenaccomplished bystandardized systematic aerial and ground surveys and study of
  nestingsuccess of nesting colonies in Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) 2 and 3 ofthe
  centralEverglades. The White Ibis work was accomplished through 1) investigation
  of thenutritional, behavioral, and hormonal aspects of \"normal\" breeding in a
  captive colony ofScarlet Ibises (Eudocimus ruber, considered by many to be the same
  species as the WhiteIbis), and 2) documenting the physiology, nutritional state,
  breeding phenology,contaminant load, and hormonal status of free- living adult White
  Ibises in the centralEverglades. (364 page document)
