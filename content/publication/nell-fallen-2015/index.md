abstract: Positive interspecific interactions can shape fundamental wetland ecosystem
  dynamics, including energy transfer and spatial distribution of nutrients. Birds,
  by foraging in one location and nesting in another, commonly act as between-ecosystem
  nutrient vectors. However, the distribution of nutrients within nesting areas and
  mechanisms of transfer to other trophic levels are poorly understood. We report
  on measurements of available food transferred from nesting long-legged wading birds
  to American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in the Everglades of Florida,
  USA. Using throughfall traps, a historic dataset on nesting success and a literature-parameterized
  alligator energy budget, we estimated the potential food available to alligators
  via regurgitant and nestling carcasses, and compared that to alligator food requirements.
  Although dropped regurgitant is of little importance to scavenging alligators, we
  estimate that nestling carcasses throughout the ecosystem could support the energetic
  requirements of hundreds of alligators for periods of several months. This resource
  occurs during the dry season, when alligator thermoregulatory opportunities are
  relatively scarce and female alligators are mobilizing resources for egg-laying.
  Our results indicate that through fallen nestlings, wading bird nesting colonies
  have strong potential to benefit alligators. This facilitative exchange may be globally
  widespread, forming a keystone process in many tropical and subtropical wetlands.
