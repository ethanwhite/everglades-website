abstract: In a sample of 1,609 marked nests of five species of Ciconiiformes in 21
  colonial nesting aggregations in the Everglades, evidence of abandonment without
  destruction of nest contents accounted for 31.3% of failures. In 66.9% of the failures,
  evidence at the nest suggested either predation resulting in nest failure or postabandonment
  scavenging of nest contents. In a sample of 106 nests isolated by a nonrepelling
  tracking medium, we found predation by snakes to account for 23% of nest failures;
  mammals accounted for an additional 20%. Failures due to these two categories accounted
  for 12% of the treated nests; abandonments may have been considerably underrepresented
  in this sample of nests. Mammalian predators rarely visited widely distributed baited
  tracking stations in the marsh, and we hypothesize that even 5-10 cm of water can
  substantially restrict travel by raccoons, foxes, and rats. Visitation by mammals
  to colonies occurred only when the water surrounding them receded, and was not related
  to the presence of alligators or distance from permanently dry land. We found little
  evidence of avian predation on wading bird nests, though birds readily scavenged
  abandoned nest contents. We discuss several attributes of the Everglades marshes
  which may limit access of predators to nesting colonies.
