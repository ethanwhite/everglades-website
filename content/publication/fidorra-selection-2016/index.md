abstract: Wetlands constructed or modified by humans (human-influenced wetlands [HIW])
  constitute an increasing proportion of wetland habitat in the USA. It is unclear
  to what extent HIW (e.g., ponds, reservoirs, impoundments, aquaculture sites, and
  flooded agricultural fields) provide equivalent habitat for wading birds compared
  with the natural wetlands they are replacing or augmenting. We compared selection
  of HIW with natural wetlands by Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in 2 regions containing
  high proportions of wetlands (73% Louisiana [LA], 39% South Carolina [SC]) and similar
  proportions of HIW (4.3% LA, 4.5% SC). Great Egrets in LA (n = 11) and SC (n = 19)
  were tracked using satellite transmitters for up to 1 year to assess selection of
  home ranges and foraging sites. We also compared selection of flooded agricultural
  fields vs. natural wetlands as foraging sites from aerial surveys of untagged egrets
  in LA. In SC, tagged birds showed stronger selection for HIW than natural wetlands
  as foraging sites, driven by use of small man-made ponds (39.9% of foraging observations),
  but home ranges did not contain a disproportionate area of ponds. In LA, tagged
  birds showed no overall selection of HIW at either scale, but unmarked egrets showed
  strong selection for crayfish aquaculture ponds, especially during drawdown. Rice
  fields provided only a short window of opportunity for foraging Great Egrets and
  were not selected over nearby natural sites. Despite widespread availability of
  HIW in the southeastern USA, our results show that natural wetlands continue to
  provide the majority of foraging habitat for Great Egrets; however, some HIW types
  (aquaculture and small ponds) may be strongly selected.
