abstract: The function of migration is to allow exploitation of resources whose availability
  is heterogeneous in space and time. Much effort has been historically directed to
  studying migration as a response to seasonal, predictable fluctuations in resource
  availability in temperate species. A deeper understanding of how different migration
  patterns emerge in response to different patterns of resource variation requires
  describing migration patterns of species inhabiting less predictable environments,
  especially in tropical and subtropical areas. We provide the first individual-based,
  quantitative description of migratory patterns in a subtropical wading bird in the
  southeastern United States, the wood stork (Mycteria americana). Using GPS tracking
  data for 64 individuals tracked between 2004 and 2017, we classified migratory behavior
  at the individual-year level using information theory-based model selection on nonlinear
  models of net squared displacement. We found that the wood stork population is partially
  migratory, with 59% of individuals seasonally commuting between winter ranges in
  Florida and summer ranges elsewhere in the population range (migrants), and 28%
  remaining in a single area in Florida year-round (residents). Additionally, 13%
  of storks act as facultative migrants, migrating in some years but not in others.
  Comparing the distribution of residents and migrants suggests that different migratory
  strategies might be associated with the use of different or differently distributed
  resources, possibly including food supplementation from human activities. The existence
  of facultative migrants shows the potential for plastic change in migratory patterns.
  Partial migration in wood storks may be an adaptation to high heterogeneity and
  unpredictability of food resources. We suggest that future research should focus
  on wading birds as model species for the study of partial migration as an adaptation
  to heterogeneous and unpredictable environments.
