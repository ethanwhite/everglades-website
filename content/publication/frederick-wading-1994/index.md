abstract: We documented the use of two wastewater treatment wetlands (secondarily
  treated urban sewage) in central Florida by wintering and breeding long-legged wading
  birds (Ciconiiformes), and compared densities of birds at these sites to a large,
  naturally fluctuating wetland nearby. Winter densities at all three sites in central
  Florida were much higher than at other natural wetlands in southern Florida and
  Nicaragua. White and Glossy Ibises (Eudocimus albus and Plegadis falcinellus) were
  much more common at the natural site in central Florida than at the wastewater sites,
  presumably because water depths at the latter sites were too deep for foraging.
  Densities of ardeids were not notably different among the sites. Breeding colonies
  of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and Great Egrets
  (Casmerodius albus) formed at both wastewater sites during the study, probably because
  water conditions were stable. Great and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) that we followed
  from these colonies often foraged in the wastewater impoundments, but Wood Storks
  and White Ibises followed from wastewater and nearby colonies rarely did. These
  wastewater impoundments appeared to offer attractive feeding conditions to ardeids,
  but not to ibises or storks, and appear to have high value as colony sites. We outline
  a number of potential health risks for wading birds using these wetlands.
