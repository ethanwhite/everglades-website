abstract: Methylmercury (MeHg) is a globally distributed neurotoxin, endocrine disruptor,
  and teratogen, and its effects on birds are poorly understood, especially within
  an environmentally relevant exposure range. In an effort to understand the potential
  causal relationship between MeHg exposure and endocrine development, we established
  four dietary exposure groups (0 [control], 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg wet wt/d of
  MeHg) of postfledging white ibises (Eudocimus albus) in a divided, free-flight aviary
  that spanned the estimated range of environmental exposure for this species. Fecal
  samples were collected from individually identified ibises over six months in 2005
  and processed for hormone evaluation. Significant sex-related differences in fecal
  estradiol concentrations, though unpredicted in direction, suggest that this steroid
  could be related to juvenile development in this species. Using repeated-measures
  general linear models, we tested a set of candidate models to explain variation
  in endocrine expression. We found that MeHg exposure led to significant differences
  in fecal estradiol concentrations between the control and medium-dose groups, whereas
  differences in fecal corticosterone concentrations were observed between the control
  and both the low- and high-dose groups. These results suggest highly nonlinear dose-response
  patterns for MeHg. Many endocrine-disrupting contaminants are theorized to affect
  multiple endpoints in a nonlinear manner, making results difficult to interpret
  using a traditional toxicological approach. The evidence presented here suggests
  that endocrine effects of MeHg exposure could behave similarly.
