abstract: Fluctuations in size and turnover of centralized, aggregative breeding locations
  are attributable to both natural and anthropogenic causes, and distinguishing between
  these sources is critical for successful conservation and management of colonially
  breeding animals. We used a 40-year data set to examine the relative importance
  of colony variables to colony dynamics of endangered Wood Storks (Mycteria americana)
  within the United States. Larger colonies were less prone to abandonment and those
  of greater longevity were more likely to re-colonize, suggesting size and previous
  history have intrinsic value to Wood Storks. Colonies with a higher degree of physical
  connection to the mainland were more likely to be abandoned, probably because the
  isolation reduces access for mammalian nest predators. Proximity to human activity
  was positively related to the probability of re-colonization, indicating either
  that Wood Storks and humans are attracted to similar ecological features, or that
  there may be some positive benefit from nesting near human activities. Local rainfall
  in the 12Â months prior to nest initiation was positively related to re-colonization
  rates and negatively related to extinction rates, suggesting that colony-site effects
  on persistence are mediated by annual weather patterns. Our findings present means
  to prioritize conservation efforts for colonial nesting waterbirds.
