abstract: Since mercury (Hg) exposure in wild vertebrates is primarily through food
  consumption, and since methylmercury is highly bioaccumulative, food web analysis
  can be especially important to understanding exposure in wild fauna. Here, we summarize
  extensive and intensive studies of food habits and Hg exposure for four well-researched
  groups of vertebrates that have outsized effects on community structure and function
  in the Everglades—mosquitofish, Florida Bass, long legged wading birds, and Florida
  Panthers. Generally these studies show that a high degree of variation in tissue
  Hg is attributable to geographic location within south Florida, usually because
  of known differences in either prey consumed or Hg concentrations in prey. Prey
  identity may be strongly shaped by local community structure—for example bass in
  canals have access to a more diverse group of prey and larger prey than those foraging
  in marshes. Similarly, shifts in panther food habits and consequently Hg exposure
  have been strongly affected by changes in available prey, driven by hydrology or
  ungulate management practices. While trophic position can be important in predicting
  Hg exposure (panthers, mosquitofish), it is interesting that in some cases (bass)
  geographic location may have an even stronger effect. Each of these species or species-groups
  has shown value as an indicator of risk, with large variation seen in Hg concentrations
  over both time and space. The ability to attribute that variation to location, trophic,
  and contaminant exposure effects has been a major contribution of these long term
  studies.
