abstract: Accurate measurements of food consumption by young birds are of great value
  in a variety of ecological studies, but traditional measurement methods are problematic
  and prone to high error. In animals that obtain their water primarily through food,
  it is possible to estimate food consumption from measurements of water influx rate,
  using radioactively labeled water (3H2O), and diet water content. We evaluated that
  method by comparing actual food consumption with simultaneous estimates of food
  consumption based on the labeled-water method in captive-reared nestling Tricolored
  Herons (Egretta tricolor). There was good agreement. The average error in the isotope
  method was âˆ’2% (SD = 8%), and that difference was not statistically significant.
  An errors analysis indicated that the accuracy of this method is sensitive to determinations
  of dietary water content and animal body water content, and to estimates of rates
  of metabolic water production and unidirectional water vapor input.
