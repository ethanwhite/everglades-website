abstract: Many wetland communities are fire prone or fire dependent, especially those
  dominated by forbs and grasses. Despite our considerable knowledge about fire effects
  on wildlife in uplands, there is a relative paucity of information about effects
  of fire in wetland systems. Long-legged wading birds (herons, egrets, ibises, storks,
  spoonbills; order Ciconiiformes) may benefit from fire through the exposure of prey
  after vegetation removal, or through a trophic response of prey to increased availability
  of nutrients and increased light. We conducted aerial surveys of foraging wading
  birds in prescribed burns and adjacent unburned areas in the central Everglades,
  Florida, USA, to determine if wading birds select for burned habitats. We measured
  aquatic prey density in burned and unburned sawgrass (Cladium mariscus [L.] Pohl
  ssp. jamaicense [Crantz] KÃ¼k), and densities of prey injured or killed in the fires.
  We also observed foraging great egrets (Ardea alba L.) in and adjacent to prescribed
  burns to determine whether foraging success (i.e., capture efficiency and capture
  rate) differed between burned and unburned areas. Great egrets and white ibises
  (Eudocimus albus L.) selected for burns and areas of deeper water adjacent to burned
  areas, and avoided dense, tall, unburned vegetation. Measured densities of prey
  killed by the fire were very low. Live aquatic prey densities did not differ between
  burned and unburned sawgrass. Great egrets had higher capture rates in sloughs adjacent
  to burns than in burned areas, but were more efficient at capturing prey in burned
  areas than in adjacent sloughs. Prescribed fires created short-term shallow water
  habitats (burned areas) with limited submerged and emergent vegetation, making prey
  in burns more vulnerable despite lower densities (availability) compared to adjacent
  sloughs. This research suggests that prescribed fire in grass-dominated wetlands
  may attract predators like wading birds primarily because removal of vegetation
  makes prey easier to capture.
