Things to consider before applying for or accepting a position with the University of Florida Wading Bird Project.

* If you don’t like to get dirty... This is not a position where we sit in blinds,
follow banded birds through the forest, or run mist nets. We’re going to be
working with dirty boat engines, walking through mucky and guano-laden waters,
and handling birds that use feces and regurgitation as defensive tools. If you have
an aversion to getting dirty, this may not be the job for you.
* If you are a smoker... the vast majority of your time will be spent in
smoke-free environments—airboats, airplanes, university vehicles, and university
housing, and nesting colonies.
* If you are prone to road rage... We’ll spend a lot of time in large, slow vehicles
towing unwieldy airboats. Miami traffic is like that of almost any large city—
frustrating and, at times, menacing. If you are either a timid or an aggressive
driver, you will find this aspect of the job challenging.
* If you are “gatorphobic”... Alligators do not normally prey on adult humans, but
they do prey on birds, and we will be frequenting nesting colonies where young
birds often fall into the waters below. That means that we’ll be working around
gators. Most will be small and actively avoid us. Some will not, but will keep
their distance. On occasion, we may walk up close to, and then around, gators in
our path. If these last two scenarios are cause for great anxiety, you may not want
this position.
* If you are regularly impacted by motion sickness... If you don’t like amusement park
rides, flying in small airplanes may not be the way you want spend your Spring.
We repeatedly circle colonies as we count and take pictures, and later in the
mornings the air gets bumpy. Most of those flying will want to take some motion
sickness preventative because we will be reading and taking notes while bouncing
along inside the (often uncomfortably warm) aircraft. If, however, you are
especially sensitive to this type of movement or get carsick easily, you may want
to pass on this job.
* If you have immune response deficiencies... Mosquitoes in most of the country
now carry West Nile Virus. Even with DEET and other mechanical forms of
protection, you are likely going to endure some mosquito bites. West Nile is
rarely serious, but those with immune response deficiencies are at special risk.

Those are the negatives. The positives of this position are many times more numerous.
The Florida Everglades area is a unique and spectacular environment in which to work.
You will see and do things few other people ever have the opportunity to experience,
something you will remember for your entire career. You will learn a range of skills that
are applicable to many other wildlife positions, and more importantly, you will (with
perseverance) demonstrate the capacity to develop and use such skills in the most
challenging of conditions.
