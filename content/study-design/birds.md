Title: Bird Species
---

Our fieldwork is focused primarily on the reproductive ecology of 11 species within the WCAs - Wood Storks, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, and White Ibis are all white-plumaged species easily seen from the air. Others are less visible - Great Blue, Tri-colored, and Little Blue herons, Yellow- and Black-crowned Night-Herons, and Glossy Ibis. Ground Surveys (done with airboats in WCA 3a) and some ground checks help us achieve better estimates of their nesting populations. Although much more common in and around Florida Bay, about a dozen Roseate Spoonbills nest in two of the larger WCA colonies.

Many other wetland species are commonly seen in our travels. These include Snail Kites, Limpkins, American and Least bitterns, Green Herons, Double-crested Cormorants, American Coots, Common Moorhens, Anhingas, and Black-necked Stilts. Species such as the Reddish Egret, Brown Pelican and Magnificent Frigatebird can be found in the Florida Bay area.
