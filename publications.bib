	abstract = {Large numbers of colonially nesting herons, egrets, ibises, storks and spoonbills were one of the defining natural phenomena of the historical Everglades. Reproduction of these species has been tracked over at least a century, and some clear responses to dramatic anthropogenic hydrological alterations have been established. These include a marked decline in nesting populations of several species, and a movement of colonies away from the over-drained estuarine region. Ponding in a large portion of the freshwater marsh has favored species that hunt by sight in deep water (egrets, cf. 25–45cm), while tactile feeders (ibises and storks) that depend on concentrated prey in shallow water (5–25cm) have become proportionately much less common. There has been a marked increase in the interval between exceptionally large breeding aggregations of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus). Loss of short hydroperiod wetlands on the margins of the Everglades have delayed nest initiations 1–2 months by Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) resulting in poor nesting success. These responses are consistent with mechanisms that involve foraging, and the availability and production of prey animals, and each of the relationships is highly dependent on hydrology. Here, we define a group of characteristics about wading bird dynamics (= indicators) that collectively track the specific ecological relationships that supported ibises and storks in the past. We suggest four metrics as indicators of restoration success: timing of nesting by storks, the ratio of nesting ibises+storks to Great Egrets, the proportion of all nests located in the estuarine/freshwater ecotone, and the interval between years with exceptionally large ibis nestings. Each of these metrics has historical (e.g., predrainage) data upon which to base expectations for restoration, and the metrics have little measurement error relative to the large annual variation in numbers of nests. In addition to the strong scientific basis for the use of these indicators, wading birds are also a powerful tool for public communication because they have strong aesthetic appeal, and their ecological relationships with water are intuitively understandable. In the interests of communicating with the public and decision-makers, we integrate these metrics into a single-page annual “traffic-light” report card for wading bird responses. Collectively, we believe these metrics offer an excellent chance of detecting restoration of the ecosystem functions that supported historical wading bird nesting patterns.},

Abandonment was the most common cause of nesting failure for all species and usually occurred following heavy rainfall and periods of rising surface water. Using stepwise logistic regression, we found that rapid surface water drying rate was associated most strongly with White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) nesting success, and that amount of rainfall was directly associated with failure of Great Egret (Casmerodius alba) nests. From records of 32 past surveys of White Ibis nesting numbers in two different water management areas, we found that years with high nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates than years with low nesting numbers. There was no significant difference in amount of spring rainfall, autumn/winter drying rate, or water depth. Abandonments by ibises appeared to be closely related to prey densities, which probably were directly affected by water-level fluctuations.},

In 66.9\% of the failures, evidence at the nest suggested either predation resulting in nest failure or postabandonment scavenging of nest contents. In a sample of 106 nests isolated by a nonrepelling tracking medium, we found predation by snakes to account for 23\% of nest failures; mammals accounted for an additional 20\%. Failures due to these two categories accounted for 12\% of the treated nests; abandonments may have been considerably underrepresented in this sample of nests. Mammalian predators rarely visited widely distributed baited tracking stations in the marsh, and we hypothesize that even 5-10 cm of water can substantially restrict travel by raccoons, foxes, and rats. Visitation by mammals to colonies occurred only when the water surrounding them receded, and was not related to the presence of alligators or distance from permanently dry land. We found little evidence of avian predation on wading bird nests, though birds readily scavenged abandoned nest contents. We discuss several attributes of the Everglades marshes which may limit access of predators to nesting colonies.},

	abstract = {Mercury, a common wetland pollutant, can affect wildlife populations through acute toxicity or through physiological effects that modify behavior and negatively influence reproductive success. We compared body-feather mercury concentrations of free-living male and female adult White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) during three breeding seasons in the Florida Everglades and examined the relationships among mercury, hormone concentrations, and body-condition scores. Female White Ibises consistently had lower mercury concentrations than males. Prebreeding females' estradiol concentrations were negatively correlated with mercury concentrations. However, we found no relationship between mercury and female testosterone, progesterone, and corticosterone concentrations. Incubating male White Ibises showed a significant positive relationship between testosterone and mercury concentrations, but no other significant hormonal correlations with mercury concentrations. We used a seven-year standardized data set of Great Egret (Ardea alba) chick-feather mercury concentrations as a measure of temporal changes in mercury bioavailability in the Everglades and related that measure to annual numbers of White Ibis nests. White Ibis nesting was negatively correlated with the mercury exposure index. Low numbers of nesting White Ibises may have been the result of fewer birds nesting or high abandonment rates. Our results suggest that mercury exposure may cause fewer birds to nest or more birds to abandon nests because of subacute effects on hormone systems. However, the results are correlative; they call for further investigation in free-living populations and in the laboratory.Relaciones entre las Concentraciones de Mercurio, Hormonas y el Esfuerzo de Nidificación de Eudocimus albus en los Everglades, Florida},

	abstract = {At the scale of ecosystems and regions, numbers of nesting long-legged wading birds are often highly variable from year to year, and much of this variation is thought to reflect variation in production or availability of prey animals in wetlands. Based on observations during and following a severe drought in the Florida Everglades (1989–1992), we predicted that large nesting events would be more likely immediately following droughts than at other times. Using a 38-year history of wading bird nesting events in the Florida Everglades, we tested the hypothesis that “supranormal” annual nesting events (numbers of nests {\textgreater}1 standard deviation above the long-term mean) would occur more frequently during the period of up to two years after severe droughts (stages {\textless}1 standard deviation below the mean) than after non-drought years. Within this database, we identified 8 supranormal events and 8 severe droughts; 7 of the nesting events occurred immediately after a drought, and 7 of the droughts were followed by a supranormal nesting event. There was a highly significant association between the two types of events. Because many studies suggest that wading bird reproduction is food-limited, this result implies that post-drought conditions somehow result in exceptional productivity and/or availability of small fishes and macroinvertebrates. We propose two biological mechanisms for this pattern and suggest that rare, severe droughts in the Everglades are a forcing function for wading bird population cycles and large-scale movements through the action of pulsed productivity in the aquatic food web.},

	abstract = {The effect of nutrient accumulation resulting from deposition of feces in colonies 
of colonially breeding and roosting wading birds is estimated in this chapter for 
breeding and nonbreeding ciconiiform birds in the Everglades ecosystem, by 
modeling energy consumption and feces deposition rates and by using existing 
measurements of size, energy, and nutrient content of prey items from the 
Everglades. Current populations of breeding and nonbreeding birds are estimated 
to consume 4.9 fewer tonnes of prey (dry mass) per year than the much larger 
populations of the 1930s and 1940s, equivalent to an estimated 14.6 million fewer 
prey items per year. This difference translates into 455 fewer tonnes of feces 
deposited in roosts and colonies per year, roughly equivalent to 59 fewer tonnes 
nitrogen and 5.6 fewer tonnes phosphorus. Nonbreeding birds are estimated to 
account for only 1.5\% of the difference in nutrient flux attributable to birds between 
the two periods, indicating that the differences are due to reductions in energyintensive breeding attempts. Although even the largest historical populations are 
estimated to have redistributed only a very small fraction of the total annual 
deposition of phosphorus and other nutrients in the marsh, loading rates at 
colonies can be extremely high. Loading rates at historical colony sites could have 
been as high as 120 g phosphorus m\_2 yr"1 (approximately 3000 times the estimated 
historic atmospheric deposition rate), while current colonies are estimated to have 
rates of only 0.9 g phosphorus irr2-yr\_1 (more than 20 times the historic atmo­
spheric deposition rate). Evidence from the Everglades and other ecosystems 
suggests that high nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of colonies has a strong 
effect on the productivity and species composition of aquatic fauna and flora. This© St. Lucie Press CCC 0-9634030-2-8 l/94/\$100/\$.50 571may have strong feedback effects for survival of young wading birds, which 
characteristically develop foraging skills at or near colony sites. Recent relocation 
of large colonies from the estuarine zone to the freshwater Everglades implies that 
nutrient input to the estuary has decreased significantly. Nutrient-rich colonies 
probably serve as islands of refugia for nutrient-tolerant species in the oligotrophic 
Everglades and may serve to significantly affect the variability in biodiversity of the 
marsh. Sources of error tend to be in the direction of overestimation of nutrients 
transported, and in this regard, the amount of food required by nestlings is a central 
and poorly understood variable.},

Great egret nestlings had a diet composed predominantly of fish ({\textgreater}95\% of biomass), though the species composition of fish in the diet fluctuated considerably among years. Great egrets concentrated on the larger fish available in the marsh, especially members of the Centrarchidae. The importance of all nonnative fish fluctuated from 0 to 32\% of the diet by biomass and was dominated by pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and cichlids (Cichlidae). Total mercury concentrations in prey fish ranged from 0.04 to 1.40 mg/kg wet weight, and we found a significant relationship between mass of individual fish and mercury concentration. We estimated the concentration of total mercury in the diet as a whole by weighting the mercury concentration in a given fish species by the proportion of that species in the diet. We estimate that total mercury concentrations in the diets ranged among years from 0.37 to 0.47 mg/kg fish (4-year mean = 0.41 mg/kg). We estimated total mercury exposure in great egret nestlings by combining these mercury concentrations with measurements of food intake rate, as measured over the course of the nestling period in both lab and field situations. We estimate that, at the 0.41 mg/kg level, nestlings would ingest 4.32 mg total mercury during an 80-day nestling period. Captive feeding studies reported elsewhere suggest that this level of exposure in the wild could be associated with reduced fledging mass, increased lethargy, decreased appetite, and, possibly, poor health and juvenile survival.},

Concentrations of total carbon, nitrogen (N), and P, and N stable isotope ratio (δ15N) were determined on soil samples from 46 tree islands. Total elemental concentrations and δ15N were determined on wading bird guano. Sequential chemical extraction of P pools was also performed on guano. Guano contained between 53.1 and 123.7g-Nkg−1 and 20.7 and 56.7g-Pkg−1. Most of the P present in guano was extractable by HCl, which ranged from 82 to 97\% of the total P. Total P of tree islands classified as having low or high P soils averaged 0.71 and 40.6gkg−1, respectively. Tree island soil with high total P concentration was found to have a similar δ15N signature and total P concentration as bird guano. Phosphorus concentrations and δ15N were positively correlated in tree island soils (r=0.83, p{\textless}0.0001). Potential input of guano with elevated concentrations of N and P, and 15N enriched N, relative to other sources suggests that guano deposition in tree island soils is a mechanism contributing to this pattern.},

	abstract = {We measured plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and corticosterone; and recorded changes in gonad size, body condition, molt, and brood patch development of free-living adult White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) during the breeding season in the Florida Everglades. White Ibises are colonially breeding, long-legged wading birds that inhabit freshwater and estuarine wetlands. They have flexible breeding schedules (nest initiation dates can range from January to September) and onset of nesting is usually associated with increased prey availability caused by concentration of small fish in pools during periods of wetland drying. In this paper, we present the hormonal and physical characteristics of White Ibis reproductive physiology. We classified White Ibis breeding into five stages: pre-breeding, display, copulation/egg production, incubation, and chick rearing. White Ibises showed cyclic gonadal development which corresponded to reproductive stage. Male and female testosterone concentrations increased during the display stage and decreased during copulation, incubation, and chick rearing. Female estradiol concentrations were highest during display and chick rearing and male estradiol concentrations were lowest during copulation. Female progesterone concentrations increased during display and remained high throughout the breeding season. Female ibises had low corticosterone concentrations that increased during incubation and were highest during chick rearing, concomitant with lower body condition and flight muscle-mass scores. Male ibis progesterone and corticosterone concentrations did not show seasonal changes and were more variable than concentrations in female ibises at similar stages. Males and females had elevated body condition scores during the display stage, which were depleted by the onset of incubation. Increased energy stores during display may be used later for fasting in male birds that do not eat during the 10-day copulation/egg production stage, and for egg production in female birds. During incubation, male and female ibises developed brood patches. Ibises molted in all stages of reproduction, indicating that ibis molt and reproductive physiology may not inhibit each other as in most temperate bird species. White Ibises showed similar patterns in reproductive physiology to other monogamous, seasonally breeding bird species in which both sexes incubate and care for the young.},

	abstract = {The Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is now established as a breeding population throughout south Florida, USA. However, the extent of the invasion, and the ecological impacts of this novel apex predator on animal communities are incompletely known, in large part because Burmese pythons (hereafter “pythons”) are extremely cryptic and there has been no efficient way to detect them. Pythons are recently confirmed nest predators of long-legged wading bird breeding colonies (orders Ciconiiformes and Pelecaniformes). Pythons can consume large quantities of prey and may not be recognized as predators by wading birds, therefore they could be a particular threat to colonies. To quantify python occupancy rates at tree islands where wading birds breed, we utilized environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis—a genetic tool which detects shed DNA in water samples and provides high detection probabilities. We fitted multi-scale Bayesian occupancy models to test the prediction that pythons occupy islands with wading bird colonies at higher rates compared to representative control islands containing no breeding birds. Our results suggest that pythons are widely distributed across the central Everglades in proximity to active wading bird colonies. In support of our prediction that pythons are attracted to colonies, site-level python eDNA occupancy rates were higher at wading bird colonies (ψ = 0.88, 95\% credible interval [0.59–1.00]) than at the control islands (ψ = 0.42 [0.16–0.80]) in April through June (n = 15 colony-control pairs). We found our water temperature proxy (time of day) to be informative of detection probability, in accordance with other studies demonstrating an effect of temperature on eDNA degradation in occupied samples. Individual sample concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 38.29 copies/μL and we generally detected higher concentrations of python eDNA in colony sites. Continued monitoring of wading bird colonies is warranted to determine the effect pythons are having on populations and investigate putative management activities.},

We visually observed 663 birds in 187 flocks, and documented their response to the powerline. We found that the flight directions and the colony site locality strongly suggested regular nocturnal foraging behavior of some species, especially Black-crowned Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Wood Storks (Mycteria americana). Birds flying at night were less likely to react to the powerline, suggesting that powerlines may pose more of a collision threat during darkness. However, we also found that waterbirds flew higher at night than during the day and thus came into a zone of potential contact with the powerline much less often than during the day.},

Between 1994 and 2000, we collected feathers of growing great egret (Ardea alba) nestlings from colonies in the freshwater Everglades of southern Florida, and during 1998, feathers were collected from chicks of both great egrets and white ibises (Eudocimus albus) at a variety of colonies throughout peninsular Florida. Coastal colonies showed significantly lower feather Hg concentrations than did inland sites. Within the Everglades, we found significant effects of both geographic location and year on age-adjusted mean total Hg concentrations in feathers. Over the course of our study, Everglades colonies maintained their Hg concentration rankings relative to one another, but all showed strongly declining Hg concentrations (mean of 73\% averaged across colonies, between 1994 and 2000). Using a previously established predictive relationship between Hg consumption in food and feather Hg for great egrets, we estimated that Hg concentrations in the aggregate diet of egrets have been reduced by an average of 67\%. We conclude that the Everglades has undergone a biologically significant decline in Hg availability in the wetland food web, possibly because of decreased local inputs.},

	abstract = {We lured White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) to trap sites with decoy plastic flamingos and captured them with a rocket net or mist nets. Our ability to attract ibises to a site (and consequently our capture success) was affected by vegetation height and water depth but not by decoy numbers or their arrangement. Both the rocket net (37 ibises) and mist nets (97 ibises) caught birds. The number of birds captured per day was the same for both methods, but the rocket net trap captured more birds per set than did mist nets. Because mist nets were easy to reset we captured 1-2 birds per set multiple times in one day with mist nets. We preferred mist nets over rocket net traps because mist nets allowed for shorter bird processing times, greater ease of set up, and fewer safety considerations for transport and operation of the trap. Also, rocket nets required more equipment and expense. Although we discouraged other species from landing at a trap site, there was evidence that these techniques may also be useful for capturing other wading birds. /// Atraimos cigueñas (Eudocimus albus) a lugares particulares utilizando señuelos de flamencos para atraparlas con redes de cohetes y con redes de neibla. Nuestra habilidad para atraer las aves a ciertas localidades fue afectada por la altura de la vegetación, la profundidad del agua, pero no así por el número de señuelos y el arreglo de estos. Se atraparon 37 individuos con red de cohetes y 97 con las de niebla. El número de aves atrapadas por dia fue similar para ambos tipos de redes. No obstante, la primera permitió más aves por conjunto de estas. Dado el caso de que las redes de niebla son más fáciles de rearreglar capturamos de 1-2 aves por conjunto de puesta. Preferimos utilizar las redes de niebla ya que estas permiten el procesar estas más rapidamente, son más fáciles de montar y necesitan menos consideraciones de cuidado para transportarlas y operarlas. Por otro lado las redes de cohetes requieren más equipo y experiencia. Aunque virtualmente evitamos a otras especies, la técnica de captura parece ser adecuada para otras especies vadeadoras.},

	abstract = {In the Everglades of southern Florida, several species of spring- and winter-nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) often abandon their nests in response to periods of cold or wet and windy weather. Using stepwise logistic regression of a variety of hydrologic and meteorologic variables on the probability of great egret nest failure, we found that cold temperatures and high wind speeds were most closely associated with nest failure in the Everglades. Water level fluctuation was not a significant correlate of failure. Quantitative visual surveys in the field showed that even moderate cooling events (15°C minimum daily temperature) dramatically altered the observed densities of marsh fishes. In controlled conditions in the laboratory, we observed centrarchid, poeciliid, and cyprinodontid fishes during normal high (19–23°C) and simulated cold snap (8–11°C) temperatures. At low temperatures, the fishes exhibited reduced activity, sought refuge by hiding in vegetation and/or substrate, and fled our approach to the tank at much greater distances. Threshold temperatures for these behaviors varied considerably between the laboratory (9–11°C) and field (15–20°C), and may be explained by differences in the previous thermal experience of the two groups of fishes. We hypothesize that the temperature-induced scarcity of fishes during spring cold snaps is an important cause of disruption of nesting for several species of wading birds in the Everglades.},

However, the timing and pattern of that increase is poorly known, and no information is available about mercury contam ination in Everglades wildlife prior to 1974. We measured methylmercury concentrations in feathers of white ibises (n = 33), great egrets (n = 7), anhingas (n = 21), and great blue herons (n = 12) from museum specimens collected from 1910 through 1980 and combined them with more recent feather samples collected from live birds (1985–2000, n = 98, 37, 49, and 7, respectively). We found no evidence of contamination of museum samples with inorganic mercuric preservatives (0.01–0.28\% of total Hg in feathers). All species showed relatively low concentrations of mercury through the 1970s ({\textless}5 μl/L dry wt for anhingas, ibises, and egrets, {\textless}10 μl/L for herons). Samples from all species taken during the 1990s showed a large and significant increase (4–5X) in MeHg concentration. This evidence suggests that most of the increase in Hg deposition during the 20th century in south Florida occurred during the last two to three decades, which is consistent with information about local source deposition. Contamination levels prior to the 1970s appear to have been associated with normal reproduction in these birds, suggesting partial evidence for a threshold of reproductive impairment.},

Low dosed birds were given methylmercury at concentrations comparable to current exposure of wild birds in the Everglades (Florida, USA). When compared with controls, low dosed birds had lower packed cell volumes, dingy feathers, increased lymphocytic cuffing in a skin test, increased bone marrow cellularity, decreased bursal wall thickness, decreased thymic lobule size, fewer lymphoid aggregates in lung, increased perivascular edema in lung, and decreased phagocytized carbon in lung. High dosed birds became severely ataxic and had severe hematologic, neurologic, and histologic changes. The most severe lesions were in immune and nervous system tissues. By comparing responses in captive and wild birds, we found that sublethal effects of mercury were detected at lower levels in captive than in wild birds, probably due to the reduced sources of variation characteristic of the highly controlled laboratory study. Conversely, thresholds for more severe changes (death, disease) occurred at lower concentrations in wild birds than in captive birds, probably because wild birds were exposed to multiple stressors. Thus caution should be used in applying lowest observed effect levels between captive and wild studies.},

Since the 1930s, the U.S. White Ibis population has made a series of long-range ({\textgreater}400 km) shifts in the center of its breeding range. Very large colonies seem to exist for less than 15 years, and to be supported by at least 800 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ of wetlands. Movements may be prompted either by degrading breeding conditions caused by both man-made and natural disturbances, or by attraction to abnormally high concentrations of prey. Wood Storks have also undergone large scale shifts in the center of breeding, but are much more philopatric to breeding sites (often {\textgreater}25 yr). They may be locally buffered from the unpredictability of food resources by the ability to forage at large distances from their colonies, and by being associated with more permanent wetlands. Preservation of specific colony sites and associated wetlands may well aid in conserving Wood Stork populations. In contrast, nomadic ibises require a different conservation approach, one that protects a geographically widespread network of wetland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Establishing a link between food availability and productivity is often central to the recovery of declining populations; however, differences in prey selection may influence how populations are affected by changes in prey availability. We determined prey selection and prey availability for 3 wading bird species, and investigated the effects of prey availability on the number of nests initiated by 6 wading bird species in the Florida Everglades, USA. To determine prey selection, we compared food items recovered from tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), snowy egret (Egretta thula), and little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) nestlings to aquatic prey availability from throw-traps across the Everglades landscape from 2012 to 2014. Tricolored heron and snowy egret prey composition was statistically similar across years, with the majority of prey biomass coming from relatively large ({\textgreater}1.9 cm) marsh fish. Little blue heron prey composition differed from the other wading bird species, and contained a higher percentage of grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) and exotic fish species. Numbers of small heron nests were positively influenced by the availability of large marsh fish across the landscape, whereas numbers of nests for other wading bird species (wood stork [Mycteria americana], great egret [Ardea alba], white ibis [Eudocimus albus]) were not. Our results suggest differences among wading bird species in their prey selection and availability. Although small heron foraging may seem restricted by their specialization on marsh fishes, their short nesting cycles allow for the phenological flexibility to delay nesting until foraging conditions are optimal. Conversely, wood storks with longer nesting cycles are more temporally constrained but have greater flexibility in prey items and foraging range. The annual number of small heron nests may be more robust to hydrological variability as a result of management action or global change than the number of wood stork nests. The temporal constraints of nesting by wood storks indicate that management of supporting wetland systems should provide continuous habitat availability during the nesting season. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

The resulting database provides evidence of at least four major geographic shifts of the breeding population of White Ibises during the period. Banding returns and colony histories demonstrate that the movements were not migratory. The extremely fast growth of most White Ibis breeding colonies indicates that local recruitment could not have fueled the large increases in breeding numbers in colonized areas. Ibises seem to colonize wetland areas that have good feeding resources and to abandon areas that lose the ability to supply this resource. Mechanisms of attraction to new sites and repulsion from degraded ones may work alone or in tandem. Degradation of breeding sites frequently occurs through natural processes, such as hurricanes, stochastic weather patterns, and wetland conditions, and the nomadic behavior of White Ibises appears to be an obligate life-history feature. Although surveys throughout the range of the U.S. population of White Ibises have never been comprehensive, available records indicate minimum breeding populations of 125,000 pairs in 1933, 170,000 pairs in 1976, and 51,000 pairs in 1991. The U.S. population as a whole appears to be decreasing. White Ibises share a suite of population, social, and movement characteristics with a number of nomadic species. Conservation strategies for these species may differ fundamentally from those targeting more sedentary species. Nomadic species may typically depend on large populations to find food and to stimulate breeding and are therefore likely to decline abruptly and unpredictably as habitat is lost or degraded. Rapid population declines may occur at population levels well above those predicted by genetic and minimum viability models. Because of its nomadic habit, the survival of this species may depend on a regional planning approach. To conserve this species we recommend a continuing commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and preservation of a mosaic of fresh and estuarine wetlands in the southeastern U.S.; the maintenance of natural disturbances needed to produce pulses of food in these wetlands, and the coordination of management efforts throughout the US., as well as between the U.S. and Cuba.},

	abstract = {Piscivorous birds are at high risk of mercury exposure in aquatic food webs, and their reproductive success is sensitive to methylmercury exposure. Although effects are convincingly shown in a handful of lab studies, sublethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations in the field, where there is a range of other natural stressors, are not well delineated. Part of that uncertainty arises because mercury concentration (hereafter, [Hg]) in adult tissues used to assess Hg risk can be influenced by Hg values in wintering grounds or other nonrelated areas. Several studies have used nestling tissues under the assumption that they better represent local risk to breeding since nestlings consume locally derived food. However, the correlation between [Hg] in nestling tissues and local breeding success remains unassessed. We analyzed great egret (Ardea alba) breeding parameters collected over 3 years (2015–2017) in the Everglades (Florida, USA). The Everglades is a large contiguous wetland with geographically dispersed wading bird breeding sites exposed to variable and biologically relevant ranges of mercury concentrations. We examined mercury concentrations in albumen and nestling blood and feathers as predictors of 6 measures of reproductive success at individual nests. Albumen [Hg] did not correlate with reproductive end points, and correlations with blood [Hg] were weak. Feather [Hg] correlated negatively with all of the posthatching endpoints and explained 8.3\% of the variance in the probability of a laid egg resulting in a fledged chick. However, most of the observed failures were hatching failures, which were not explained by albumen [Hg], and other nestling tissues could therefore not be evaluated. While our results support the use of nestling feathers as indicators of site-specific mercury exposure, we discuss both advantages and possible limitations of using nestling feathers as indicators of local mercury exposure.},

	abstract = {Nestling feathers are often used to monitor and estimate Hg exposure in birds. Decision-making and results of studies on effects of exposure to Hg depend on adequate estimation of [Hg] at the studied level, which in turn is sensitive to variation in [Hg] in sampling units. However, there is little information on how feather [Hg] varies within nestlings, between nest mates, or between broods. We sampled feathers from sibling great egret nestlings in three breeding colonies of the Everglades where birds were exposed to variable Hg levels through diet. We compared the deviation of samples from average [Hg] within four levels of aggregation: individual (different scapular feathers of the same individual); brood (samples from siblings in the same nest), breeding colonies; and the entire wetland ecosystem. We found, on average, little intra-individual ({\textless}2\%) and intra-brood ({\textless}6\%) differences in [Hg], and no effects of chick hatch order in feather [Hg]. Further, intra-brood variability was not statistically different from intra-individual variability in [Hg]. In contrast, there was much higher variation between broods within colonies ({\textgreater}20\%) and within the entire wetland ({\textgreater}30\%) that could bias estimates of exposure to Hg obtained through small sample sizes. We simulated the influence of inter-brood variability in estimates of exposure to Hg under different sample sizes, and we found that uncertainty decreases markedly with samples sizes {\textgreater}6, and suggest a sample size of 10 individuals from different nests for monitoring programs and to estimate Hg contamination in areas where no previous knowledge is available.},

A suite of waterbirds was selected based on their perceived sensitivity to pressures in multiple coastal habitat types. The list of species was refined on the basis of a review of life history for characteristics that might make the species particularly vulnerable. Each selected species was then evaluated for sensitivity to the identified pressures using a hierarchical assessment that took into account the sensitivity, severity, and the temporal and spatial scales of the indicator to the given pressures.

Tricolored Herons were commonest in marine habitats, while Snowy Egrets and Little Blue Herons were most common in estuarine and freshwater habitats, respectively. Among Tricolored Herons, we found no evidence for consistent differences in laying date among the three habitats, and no relationship between clutch size and laying date. Among Tricolored Herons and Snowy Egrets, clutch sizes were larger in freshwater areas than in either of the two saline habitats, with no consistent differences in clutch size between marine and estuarine locations. Survival of nests was consistently higher in freshwater and marine than in estuarine habitat, an effect largely attributable to heavy egg predation by Common Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in estuarine colonies during incubation. Fledging success of Snowy Egrets and Tricolored Herons also was consistently higher in freshwater habitats than in either of the saline habitats. Thus, freshwater habitats showed generally increased nesting success and productivity over saline ones. Potential explanations for these differences among habitats include increased nest predation in estuarine colonies, a degrading estuarine and marine food web in the region, and the energetic constraints of salt excretion.},

We examined a specific type of mutualism, ‘protective nesting associations,’ between herons and egrets (Ardeidae) and American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). We predicted that wading birds would be attracted to sites with alligators. A survey of potential nesting sites in the Everglades showed strong nonrandom association, with wading birds never nesting without alligators. At previously unoccupied nesting colony sites, we experimentally manipulated apparent densities of alligators and birds using alligator and bird decoys. Small day-herons (little blue herons (Egretta caerulea), tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), and snowy egrets (Egretta thula)) were significantly more numerous at sites with both alligator and bird decoys than other treatments. These findings together support the hypothesis that wading birds actively choose predator-protected nesting locations based in part on information from both conspecifics and alligators, and suggest that the mechanism supporting this habitat choice is primarily due to nest protection benefits the alligators inadvertently provide. We propose that this interaction is strong and could be geographically widespread, and suggest that it may be critical to shaping management and conservation of wetland function.},

Birds, by foraging in one location and nesting in another, commonly act as between-ecosystem nutrient vectors. However, the distribution of nutrients within nesting areas and mechanisms of transfer to other trophic levels are poorly understood. We report on measurements of available food transferred from nesting long-legged wading birds to American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in the Everglades of Florida, USA. Using throughfall traps, a historic dataset on nesting success and a literature-parameterized alligator energy budget, we estimated the potential food available to alligators via regurgitant and nestling carcasses, and compared that to alligator food requirements. Although dropped regurgitant is of little importance to scavenging alligators, we estimate that nestling carcasses throughout the ecosystem could support the energetic requirements of hundreds of alligators for periods of several months. This resource occurs during the dry season, when alligator thermoregulatory opportunities are relatively scarce and female alligators are mobilizing resources for egg-laying. Our results indicate that through fallen nestlings, wading bird nesting colonies have strong potential to benefit alligators. This facilitative exchange may be globally widespread, forming a keystone process in many tropical and subtropical wetlands.},

	abstract = {Determining habitat quality for wildlife populations requires relating a species' habitat to its survival and reproduction. Within a season, species occurrence and density can be disconnected from measures of habitat quality when resources are highly seasonal, unpredictable over time, and patchy. Here we establish an explicit link among dynamic selection of changing resources, spatio-temporal species distributions, and fitness for predictive abundance and occurrence models that are used for short-term water management and long-term restoration planning. We used the wading bird distribution and evaluation models (WADEM) that estimate (1) daily changes in selection across resource gradients, (2) landscape abundance of flocks and individuals, (3) conspecific foraging aggregation, and (4) resource unit occurrence (at fixed 400 m cells) to quantify habitat quality and its consequences on reproduction for wetland indicator species. We linked maximum annual numbers of nests detected across the study area and nesting success of Great Egrets (Ardea alba), White Ibises (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) over a 20-year period to estimated daily dynamics of food resources produced by WADEM over a 7490 km2 area. For all species, increases in predicted species abundance in March and high abundance in April were strongly linked to breeding responses. Great Egret nesting effort and success were higher when birds also showed greater conspecific foraging aggregation. Synthesis and applications: This study provides the first empirical evidence that dynamic habitat selection processes and distributions of wading birds over environmental gradients are linked with reproductive measures over periods of decades. Further, predictor variables at a variety of temporal (daily-multiannual) resolutions and spatial (400 m to regional) scales effectively explained variation in ecological processes that change habitat quality. The process used here allows managers to develop short- and long-term conservation strategies that (1) consider flexible behavioral patterns and (2) are robust to environmental variation over time.},

In birds, foraging efficiency and learning may be sensitive endpoints for sublethal methylmercury toxicity, and these endpoints also may be biologically relevant at the population level. In the present study, groups of wild-caught, prefledgling white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were raised in a free-flight, open-air aviary on diets that approximated the measured range of methylmercury exposure in the Everglades ecosystem (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/d). The effect of methylmercury exposure on group foraging efficiency was examined by allowing birds to forage on 200 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in artificial ponds for 15 min by straining the arenas' contents through a seine net and counting all remaining prey. Additionally, we varied the difficulty of foraging by these tactile feeding birds by adding multiple levels of structural complexity (e.g., increased vegetation and prey refugia) to the pond. Structural complexity affected both foraging efficiency and the rate of increase in efficiency over time (improvement). Methylmercury exposure affected foraging efficiency (p = 0.03). It did not affect foraging improvement in the face of increasingly challenging environments, however, and the dose-response relationship was nonlinear (e.g., the control and high-exposure groups were the least efficient foragers). Evidence for an effect of methylmercury on foraging efficiency therefore was inconclusive because of unpredicted results and no interaction with time or habitat complexity. These data suggest a nonlinear dose-response relationship at low levels of methylmercury exposure; future research is needed to verify this hypothesis. This appears to be the first experimental demonstration of the effects of habitat complexity on foraging efficiency in long-legged wading birds.},

Despite our considerable knowledge about fire effects on wildlife in uplands, there is a relative paucity of information about effects of fire in wetland systems. Long-legged wading birds (herons, egrets, ibises, storks, spoonbills; order Ciconiiformes) may benefit from fire through the exposure of prey after vegetation removal, or through a trophic response of prey to increased availability of nutrients and increased light. We conducted aerial surveys of foraging wading birds in prescribed burns and adjacent unburned areas in the central Everglades, Florida, USA, to determine if wading birds select for burned habitats. We measured aquatic prey density in burned and unburned sawgrass (Cladium mariscus [L.] Pohl ssp. jamaicense [Crantz] Kük), and densities of prey injured or killed in the fires. We also observed foraging great egrets (Ardea alba L.) in and adjacent to prescribed burns to determine whether foraging success (i.e., capture efficiency and capture rate) differed between burned and unburned areas. Great egrets and white ibises (Eudocimus albus L.) selected for burns and areas of deeper water adjacent to burned areas, and avoided dense, tall, unburned vegetation. Measured densities of prey killed by the fire were very low. Live aquatic prey densities did not differ between burned and unburned sawgrass. Great egrets had higher capture rates in sloughs adjacent to burns than in burned areas, but were more efficient at capturing prey in burned areas than in adjacent sloughs. Prescribed fires created short-term shallow water habitats (burned areas) with limited submerged and emergent vegetation, making prey in burns more vulnerable despite lower densities (availability) compared to adjacent sloughs. This research suggests that prescribed fire in grass-dominated wetlands may attract predators like wading birds primarily because removal of vegetation makes prey easier to capture.},

In the oligotrophic Everglades of Florida, USA, we conducted a 2 × 2 factorial experiment using prescribed burns over standing water (increased nutrients and light), mowing with removal of above-water vegetation (no nutrient increase), and shade houses (no light) to test the prediction that fire effects would lead to more periphyton biomass and greater abundance and size of fish compared to other treatments. We observed increased periphyton percent cover and biomass per area in response to fire treatments. Fish abundance showed a short-term increase in burned plots. Fish length, mass, and condition factor did not respond consistently to treatments, though some species responded to specific treatments. Wildfires in dry marshes that may combust organic soils and vegetation may impact wetlands more than prescribed burns in flooded marshes.

	abstract = {Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) breed in colonies widely dispersed across approximately 3,350 km2 within the United States, and effective monitoring of this population presents immediate tradeoffs between coverage, accuracy, and cost. Here, we summarize surveys in Florida 1991-2005 as a first step towards improving existing survey strategies. In order to determine whether counts from aircraft are a suitable technique for quantifying nests, we compared aerial and ground counts at the same eleven colonies in 2004. Across all colonies, aerial counts averaged 8.1\% more nests, probably as result of either better visibility or mistakenly including Great Egret (Ardea alba) nests in the count. During the period 1991-2005, statewide totals in Florida ranged from 2,211-6,449 nests, with an apparently increasing trend through time. Annual modal colony size fluctuated from 65-144 nests, with significantly smaller modal size in 2001-2004, suggesting that colony size has decreased over time. Current survey practices are to visit all previously active colonies and all new ones that are reported or that are encountered during flights between known colonies. Surveys are not systematic, and the number or importance of novel, undetected colonies is unknown. In south Florida, where past and potential colony sites have been systematically surveyed annually, turnover (proportion of colony sites different in two surveys) increased rapidly with interval between surveys, and within 10 years, {\textgreater}80\% of colony sites differed. Annual turnover rates were not uniform across years, and young colonies appeared to have higher turnover than older ones (up to 4 years). Novel systematic aerial transects across suitable habitat in central Florida revealed approximately one novel colony/525 km2. Thus, abandonment of old colonies and formation of new ones is a typical and fairly rapid process in this species. Throughout the state, larger colonies were more persistent, and were surveyed more often than small colonies. The bias of the current nonsystematic survey strategy is towards visiting older colonies that are likely to disappear within 15 years, and against finding newer, growing colonies. This is likely to bias estimates of total population downwards compared to true values. We strongly recommend that surveys be geographically systematic, even if this reduces coverage. We suggest these systematic surveys be located in large blocks (hundreds or even thousands of km2) in areas with suitable habitat and historically high colony densities.},

	abstract = {Toxin emissions and legacies are major global issues affecting many species through, among other effects, endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment. Assessment of toxin risk to wildlife focuses mostly on offspring-related metrics, while the lack of breeding initiation or early breeding failure has received less attention. We tested whether exposure to methyl mercury (MeHg) results in early breeding failure and reduced number of breeding birds using observational and experimental data. We used 21 years of numbers of breeding pairs of colonially breeding wild Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in response to annual and geographical variation upon exposure to environmental MeHg. After controlling for food availability, we found a strong negative association between MeHg exposure and the number of breeding Great Egrets. We report reductions of {\textgreater}50\% in breeding numbers under exposure levels otherwise associated with {\textless}20\% reduction in post-egg-laying breeding success. Experimental exposure of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) to MeHg also caused early breeding failure and a ∼20\% reduction in breeding numbers at environmentally relevant exposures. The demographic consequences of reductions in breeding pairs are additive to known and typically studied impairments in postlaying reproductive success. Net demographic effects of exposure to endocrine disruptors may often be strongly underestimated if early breeding failure is not measured.},

	abstract = {Ecological associations where one species enhances habitat for another nearby species (facilitations) shape fundamental community dynamics and can promote niche expansion, thereby influencing how and where species persist and coexist. For the many breeding birds facing high nest-predation pressure, enemy-free space can be gained by nesting near more formidable animals for physical protection. While the benefits to protected species seem well documented, very few studies have explored whether and how protector species are affected by nest protection associations. Long-legged wading birds (Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes) actively choose nesting sites above resident American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), apparently to take advantage of the protection from mammalian nest predators that alligator presence offers. Previous research has shown that wading bird nesting colonies could provide substantial food for alligators in the form of dropped chicks. We compared alligator body condition in similar habitat with and without wading bird nesting colonies present. Alligator morphometric body condition indices were significantly higher in colony than in non-colony locations, an effect that was statistically independent of a range of environmental variables. Since colonially nesting birds and crocodilians co-occur in many tropical and subtropical wetlands, our results highlight a potentially widespread keystone process between two ecologically important species-groups. These findings suggest the interaction is highly beneficial for both groups of actors, and illustrate how selective pressures may have acted to form and reinforce a strongly positive ecological interaction.},

	abstract = {Methylmercury is a globally distributed pollutant and upper trophic level aquatic fauna are at particularly high risk of exposure. Although methylmercury is known to have a number of neurological and developmental effects, relatively little is known about effects on endocrine disruption and reproduction in aquatic fauna, particularly in response to chronic exposure at low concentrations. We experimentally exposed captive white ibises for 3.5 years (2005–2008) to dietary methylmercury at three environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.3ppm wet weight in diet). We measured fecal concentrations of estradiol and testosterone metabolites in two consecutive breeding seasons (2007 and 2008). When effects were controlled for stage of breeding, this resulted in altered estradiol and testosterone concentrations in adult breeders of both sexes. Changes in endocrine expression were not consistent over both years, and a clear dose–response relationship was not always present. Endocrine changes were, however, associated at all dose levels with changes in reproductive behavior, reduced reproductive success and altered mate choice in males. Male–male pairing and altered courtship behavior in males were related both to dose treatment and, in 2008, to a demasculinized pattern of endocrine expression. Changes in hormone concentrations of dosed homosexually paired males, when present, were in the same direction but at a higher magnitude than those in heterosexual dosed males. Dosed homosexual males showed decreased testosterone during nest-building and elevated testosterone during incubation when compared with their dosed heterosexual counterparts during the 2008 breeding season. In the same year, exposed males had elevated estradiol during courtship, but had decreased estradiol during other stages in comparison with controls. Dosed females generally showed decreased estradiol and testosterone concentrations compared to controls, albeit not with a clear dose–response effect. Our findings suggest that endocrine disruption due to chronic exposure to even low concentrations of dietary methylmercury may be a widespread mechanism by which reproduction is impaired in wild bird populations.},

	abstract = {It remains unclear how sub-lethal effects of contaminants play out in relation to other stressors encountered by free-ranging populations. Effects may be masked or influenced by interactions with field stressors such as food availability. We predicted that (1) including food availability, and particularly its interaction with Hg, would reveal or enhance associations between Hg and breeding endpoints. We further predicted that (2) breeding impairment associated with Hg would be higher under food stress conditions. We monitored Hg and nest success of great egrets (Ardea alba) in eight breeding colonies in the Florida Everglades over 11 years. We characterized variation in local food availability among colonies and years using fish biomass and recession range –a proxy to fish vulnerability. We used two Hg exposure indicators (egg albumen Hg and nestling feather Hg) and six breeding endpoints (clutch-size, brood-size, fledged-size, hatching success, post-hatching success and fledglings per egg) to assess whether variation in food availability influenced associations between Hg and these endpoints. Accounting for interactions between Hg and food availability, we identified statistically significant associations in all 12 indicator-endpoint combinations, while only three were detectable without food. Further, 10 combinations showed interactions between Hg and components of food availability. Our results also indicated an endpoint-specific affinity, with albumen [Hg] explaining more variation in hatching success while nestling feather [Hg] explained more variation in post-hatching survival. Both Hg indicators accounted for relevant (6–10\%) amounts of variation in fledglings produced per egg laid, an integrative endpoint. Increased Hg exposure resulted in overall reduced reproductive success when food availability was low, but our models predicted low or no effects of increasing Hg exposure when food availability was high. Our results indicate that Hg induced impairment is strongly driven by food availability, providing a framework that accommodates previously contradictory results in the literature.},

Much attention has been devoted to estimation of bias in detection of animals that are present at the time of survey. However, an equally important problem is estimation of population size when all animals are not present on all survey occasions. Here, we showcase use of the superpopulation approach to capture–recapture modeling for estimating populations where group membership is asynchronous, and where considerable overlap in group membership among sampling occasions may occur. We estimate total population size of long-legged wading bird (Great Egret and White Ibis) breeding colonies from aerial observations of individually identifiable nests at various times in the nesting season. Initiation and termination of nests were analogous to entry and departure from a population. Estimates using the superpopulation approach were 47–382\% larger than peak aerial counts of the same colonies. Our results indicate that the use of the superpopulation approach to model nesting asynchrony provides a considerably less biased and more efficient estimate of nesting activity than traditional methods. We suggest that this approach may also be used to derive population estimates in a variety of situations where group membership is fluid.},

Large aggregations of colonially breeding birds are known as nutrient sources through deposition of feces, but also may deposit large quantities of energy in the form of dead nestlings. The magnitude and ecological relevance of this process to the scavenger community is poorly understood. We used trail cameras to monitor the fates of size-appropriate chicken carcasses in heron colonies in order to quantify the proportion of available fallen nestlings that were consumed by scavengers in the Everglades of Florida, USA. Overall, 85\% of 160 carcasses were consumed, with Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura, 47\%) and American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis, 29\%) being the primary consumers. Probability of consumption by alligators or vultures was related to distance from nest to water, local nesting density, and colony type. Consumption probabilities of both scavengers in relation to habitat covariates suggested clear resource partitioning promoting coexistence. We estimate fallen nestlings throughout this ecosystem could support 16\% of the alligator population and 147 adult Turkey Vultures during a nesting season. This work indicates that fallen nestlings can serve as an important source of energy for scavengers at colonial breeding aggregations, particularly in oligotrophic systems.},

	abstract = {The function of migration is to allow exploitation of resources whose availability is heterogeneous in space and time. Much effort has been historically directed to studying migration as a response to seasonal, predictable fluctuations in resource availability in temperate species. A deeper understanding of how different migration patterns emerge in response to different patterns of resource variation requires describing migration patterns of species inhabiting less predictable environments, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. We provide the first individual-based, quantitative description of migratory patterns in a subtropical wading bird in the southeastern United States, the wood stork (Mycteria americana). Using GPS tracking data for 64 individuals tracked between 2004 and 2017, we classified migratory behavior at the individual-year level using information theory-based model selection on nonlinear models of net squared displacement. We found that the wood stork population is partially migratory, with 59\% of individuals seasonally commuting between winter ranges in Florida and summer ranges elsewhere in the population range (migrants), and 28\% remaining in a single area in Florida year-round (residents). Additionally, 13\% of storks act as facultative migrants, migrating in some years but not in others. Comparing the distribution of residents and migrants suggests that different migratory strategies might be associated with the use of different or differently distributed resources, possibly including food supplementation from human activities. The existence of facultative migrants shows the potential for plastic change in migratory patterns. Partial migration in wood storks may be an adaptation to high heterogeneity and unpredictability of food resources. We suggest that future research should focus on wading birds as model species for the study of partial migration as an adaptation to heterogeneous and unpredictable environments.},

	abstract = {Mercury is a global contaminant with special relevance for aquatic food webs, where biomagnification can result in strong effects on apex predators. Non-lethal sampling of tissues such as blood and feathers is often used to assess mercury risk and spatiotemporal variability of mercury exposure on avian populations. However, the assumption that samples from individuals within a population are representative of local mercury exposure underpins those approaches. While this assumption may be justified, it is rarely expressed quantitatively. Further, the stability of the tissue/exposure relationship over time or space may depend on the sampling medium used, since some tissues and age classes may be better at reflecting local or short-term changes in exposure. Here, we present analyses of mercury concentrations from three tissues (albumen, blood and feathers) of the same individual great egret (Ardea alba) nestlings from breeding colonies in the Florida Everglades collected over three consecutive years. The interaction of year and colony location explained at least 50\% of the observed variation in mercury concentration in all the sampled tissues. Annual colony-wide average Hg concentrations in any of the sampled tissues correlated with average Hg concentrations in the other two tissues from the same colony (R2 {\textgreater} 0.53 in every case), while concentrations in albumen, blood and feathers from the same individual correlated poorly (R2 {\textless} 0.23 in every case). We suggest that despite high variation between and within individuals of the same colony, annual colony-averaged mercury concentrations in albumen, nestling blood or feathers can be representative indicators of annual geographic differences in mercury exposure. These results support the use of non-lethal sampling of nestling tissues to reflect local mercury exposure over large spatial scales.},

On sequential capture dates we caught significantly fewer females than males. Through this time period male nestlings had higher body condition indices (mass/tarsus) than females, though the rates at which male and female body condition increased over the week were not significantly different. Several sources of evidence suggest that our sampling was not sex-biased and was reflective of actual changes in abundance of males and females. These data indicate that despite the greater caloric requirements of males, their larger size may have conferred a competitive advantage over female siblings in obtaining food from parents during a time of food shortage.},

changing over time due to natural or anthropogenic perturbations. Animal indicators are often used for
this purpose, as they are highly visible, reactive, easily measured, and of intuitive value to the wider public
(Morrison, 1986; Landres et al., 1988; Kushlan, 1993; Frederick and Ogden, 2003). Various attributes of
animal populations or communities (e.g., population size, reproductive success, habitat use, species
composition) may provide information about other ecosystem attributes that are more difficult to measure
(e.g., trophic structure, hydrology, contamination). When one or a small number of species are used to
provide information about other members or attributes of an ecosystem, they are referred to as “surrogate
species” (Caro and O’Doherty, 1999). The role of surrogate species may fall into one of the following
categories: health indicator, biodiversity indicator, umbrella species, keystone species, or flagship species.
There is much literature on the use of surrogate species; Table 26.1 provides definitions of terms commonly
used when referring to vertebrate indicator species, and Table 26.2 lists attributes that must be considered
when choosing an appropriate indicator species within a specific ecological system.},

	abstract = {We documented the use of two wastewater treatment wetlands (secondarily treated urban sewage) in central Florida by wintering and breeding long-legged wading birds (Ciconiiformes), and compared densities of birds at these sites to a large, naturally fluctuating wetland nearby. Winter densities at all three sites in central Florida were much higher than at other natural wetlands in southern Florida and Nicaragua. White and Glossy Ibises (Eudocimus albus and Plegadis falcinellus) were much more common at the natural site in central Florida than at the wastewater sites, presumably because water depths at the latter sites were too deep for foraging. Densities of ardeids were not notably different among the sites. Breeding colonies of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus) formed at both wastewater sites during the study, probably because water conditions were stable. Great and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) that we followed from these colonies often foraged in the wastewater impoundments, but Wood Storks and White Ibises followed from wastewater and nearby colonies rarely did. These wastewater impoundments appeared to offer attractive feeding conditions to ardeids, but not to ibises or storks, and appear to have high value as colony sites. We outline a number of potential health risks for wading birds using these wetlands.},

	abstract = {Many birds undergo bare part color changes during the breeding season. Most investigators have focused on color as a signal of individual quality. An alternative, but not exclusive, function of bare part color may be signaling readiness to breed, especially in colonial, asynchronous breeders. White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) are colonial waterbirds that show vivid bare part colors on their bills and legs during reproduction. We quantified bill and leg colors to describe color changes and their possible relationship to reproductive status during the breeding season of White Ibises in the Florida Everglades from 1998 to 2001. We also examined the correlation between bare part colors and circulating concentrations of sex steroids to understand the factors that regulate bare part colors. During the display stage, male and female ibises developed dark pink bills and scarlet legs. As the breeding season progressed, bills and legs faded and developed a muted pink hue. The bare part colors of female ibises were correlated with testosterone concentrations, but those of male ibises were not correlated with any hormones. A discriminant function analysis based on principal component scores (representing variation in saturation and hue) and the amount of black on the bill successfully classified ibis reproductive stage 94\% of the time. The use of bare part colors to determine reproductive status may be useful for studying reproduction in colonially nesting birds, where access to breeding sites can be difficult and potential for researcher disturbance is high.},

	abstract = {Invasive Burmese pythons have been shown to have population-level effects on native mammals in southern Florida. Tens of thousands of long-legged wading birds (of multiple species in Ciconiiformes, Pelecaniformes) breed in aggregations, known as colonies, on tree islands in the Everglades. Burmese pythons may pose a threat to these colonies because pythons are semi-aquatic and commonly use tree islands and arboreal habitat. However, python predation on nests of wading birds has not previously been documented or quantified. We used trail cameras to monitor nests at colonies in Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Area 3 in 2014, and 2016–2017. We did not detect Burmese python predation at monitored nests in 2014 (23 nests in 2 colonies) or 2016 (59 nests in 4 colonies). In 2017 (125 nests in 7 colonies), we detected three individual pythons consuming nestlings, fledglings, and eggs in a minimum of 7.9\% (5 nests, n = 63) of monitored nests at a colony in Everglades National Park. In 2017, the overall predation rate of Burmese pythons at all monitored nests (5 of 125 nests, or 4\%), was five times the native predator rate (1 of 125 nests, or 0.8\%). Our study confirms that Burmese pythons are acting as predators in wading bird colonies at nontrivial rates and provides a baseline to which future studies can refer.},

	abstract = {Measurement of survival in nestling ciconiiforms is difficult due to dense vegetation, cryptically plumaged young, and unpredictable movements of mobile nestlings in treetops. Thus, we used posturesensing radio transmitters to measure survival of nestling tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) during the 40- to 50-day period when young are mobile in the colony but dependent upon parental feedings; we used the known survival of birds marked with radio transmitters to assess the use of other techniques to estimate survival. We found nestling mortality rates nearly 3 times as high in the post-mobile stage as during the pre-mobile stage. Nestling censuses that used unique color-band combinations along a marked nest transect became unreliable after 21 days of age. Similarly, censuses of young in congregation and loafing areas within the colony resulted in large underestimates of nestling survival. Poor detectability of carcasses on transect walks (33-50\%) precluded use of carcass counts to estimate chick mortality directly. We conclude that telemetry is probably the only reliable method for the accurate measurement of nestling survival in most colony situations.},

	abstract = {Methylmercury (MeHg) is a globally distributed neurotoxin, endocrine disruptor, and teratogen, and its effects on birds are poorly understood, especially within an environmentally relevant exposure range. In an effort to understand the potential causal relationship between MeHg exposure and endocrine development, we established four dietary exposure groups (0 [control], 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg wet wt/d of MeHg) of postfledging white ibises (Eudocimus albus) in a divided, free-flight aviary that spanned the estimated range of environmental exposure for this species. Fecal samples were collected from individually identified ibises over six months in 2005 and processed for hormone evaluation. Significant sex-related differences in fecal estradiol concentrations, though unpredicted in direction, suggest that this steroid could be related to juvenile development in this species. Using repeated-measures general linear models, we tested a set of candidate models to explain variation in endocrine expression. We found that MeHg exposure led to significant differences in fecal estradiol concentrations between the control and medium-dose groups, whereas differences in fecal corticosterone concentrations were observed between the control and both the low- and high-dose groups. These results suggest highly nonlinear dose-response patterns for MeHg. Many endocrine-disrupting contaminants are theorized to affect multiple endpoints in a nonlinear manner, making results difficult to interpret using a traditional toxicological approach. The evidence presented here suggests that endocrine effects of MeHg exposure could behave similarly.},

	abstract = {Although methylated mercury (MeHg) is known to have neurological, immunological, reproductive, and endocrine effects on vertebrates at low environmental exposure levels, effects on survival of exposed birds have not been demonstrated in the wild. Here, we report on survival of the same group of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus) during exposure to 4 levels of dietary MeHg in captivity and later as depurated free-ranging animals. Ibises were chronically exposed in captivity to dietary MeHg in groups at 0 (control), 0.05 (Low), 0.1 (Medium) and 0.3 (High) ppm MeHg ww for 43 months. No differences in annualized survival among captive MeHg groups were seen within age classes. Survival of all ages taken together was significantly lower for Control birds than for Low or Medium dosed birds, but was not different from High dosed birds. While this might be evidence of a hormetic effect, none of the captive results support the prediction that MeHg impairs survival. Using a mark-recapture analysis we found no effects of dose group or of Hg exposure on survival or resight probabilities during the first 99 days post-release to the wild. The latter results suggest that there is no lasting, post-depuration effect of even high MeHg exposure (0.3 ppm ww dietary) on survival. While these results agree with a variety of studies of survival of free-ranging birds, we suggest many survival studies have been confounded by seasonal depuration through molt, and variation in exposure rates. We suggest future studies concentrate on evaluating survival effects during nonmolting periods in species for which methylmercury exposure is relatively constant.},

It is unclear to what extent HIW (e.g., ponds, reservoirs, impoundments, aquaculture sites, and flooded agricultural fields) provide equivalent habitat for wading birds compared with the natural wetlands they are replacing or augmenting. We compared selection of HIW with natural wetlands by Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in 2 regions containing high proportions of wetlands (73\% Louisiana [LA], 39\% South Carolina [SC]) and similar proportions of HIW (4.3\% LA, 4.5\% SC). Great Egrets in LA (n = 11) and SC (n = 19) were tracked using satellite transmitters for up to 1 year to assess selection of home ranges and foraging sites. We also compared selection of flooded agricultural fields vs. natural wetlands as foraging sites from aerial surveys of untagged egrets in LA. In SC, tagged birds showed stronger selection for HIW than natural wetlands as foraging sites, driven by use of small man-made ponds (39.9\% of foraging observations), but home ranges did not contain a disproportionate area of ponds. In LA, tagged birds showed no overall selection of HIW at either scale, but unmarked egrets showed strong selection for crayfish aquaculture ponds, especially during drawdown. Rice fields provided only a short window of opportunity for foraging Great Egrets and were not selected over nearby natural sites. Despite widespread availability of HIW in the southeastern USA, our results show that natural wetlands continue to provide the majority of foraging habitat for Great Egrets; however, some HIW types (aquaculture and small ponds) may be strongly selected.},

	abstract = {Estimating detection error, as well as the magnitude of other potential survey biases, is essential when sampling efforts play a role in the estimation of population size and management of wildlife populations. We quantified visual biases in aerial surveys of nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) in colonies in the Florida Everglades using a negative binomial count regression model to compare numbers of nests in quadrats counted on the ground with numbers estimated from aerial photographs of the same quadrats. The model also allowed the determination of degree of difference between monitoring results based upon such factors as nest density, vegetative cover, and nest turnover rates. Aerial surveys of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) colonies underestimated the true number of nests found during ground counts by 11.1\%, and underestimates were significantly greater (P= 0.047) in a colony with high nest turnover. Error rates did not differ for quadrats that varied in the density of White Ibis nests did not differ, and visual bias did not increase with vegetative complexity (P= 0.73). Estimates of nest density in colonies of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) based on aerial surveys were higher than ground counts for 38\% of the quadrats sampled, and mean visual bias was 23.1\%. Species misidentification likely contributed to visibility bias for Great Egrets in our study, with some Snowy Egrets almost certainly mistaken for Great Egrets in aerial photos. Biases of the magnitude we observed fro Great Egrets and White Ibises can mask true population trends in long-term monitoring and, therefore, we recommend that detection probability be explicitly evaluated when conducting aerial surveys of nesting birds.},

Using a simple, count-based diffusion approximation approach we were able to quantify an increasing population trend since 1976. High inter-year variability resulted in wide confidence intervals and we could not eliminate the possibility of long-term population decline in spite of recently measured population increases. We also used a stage-based population matrix model to incorporate observed differences in survival rates among age classes. Fledging success, and survival of fledglings, one, and two-year-old birds were estimated using data from the satellite telemetry study. Because the survival rates of three-year-olds and adults are presently unknown, we analyzed population dynamics over a range of these values. Long-term population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship. This deterministic matrix model indicated that adult survival rates {\textgreater}0.94 were necessary to maintain a growing population, an estimate considerably higher than that observed in the European White Stork (Ciconia ciconia). This study underscores the need for reliable estimates of juvenile and adult survival in Wood Storks, and for a conservation focus on the factors that affect adult survival. It also provides a tool for understanding and projecting potential trajectories of the Wood Stork population in the Southeastern United States.},

We used a 40-year data set to examine the relative importance of colony variables to colony dynamics of endangered Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) within the United States. Larger colonies were less prone to abandonment and those of greater longevity were more likely to re-colonize, suggesting size and previous history have intrinsic value to Wood Storks. Colonies with a higher degree of physical connection to the mainland were more likely to be abandoned, probably because the isolation reduces access for mammalian nest predators. Proximity to human activity was positively related to the probability of re-colonization, indicating either that Wood Storks and humans are attracted to similar ecological features, or that there may be some positive benefit from nesting near human activities. Local rainfall in the 12 months prior to nest initiation was positively related to re-colonization rates and negatively related to extinction rates, suggesting that colony-site effects on persistence are mediated by annual weather patterns. Our findings present means to prioritize conservation efforts for colonial nesting waterbirds.},

	abstract = {Since mercury (Hg) exposure in wild vertebrates is primarily through food consumption, and since methylmercury is highly bioaccumulative, food web analysis can be especially important to understanding exposure in wild fauna. Here, we summarize extensive and intensive studies of food habits and Hg exposure for four well-researched groups of vertebrates that have outsized effects on community structure and function in the Everglades—mosquitofish, Florida Bass, long legged wading birds, and Florida Panthers. Generally these studies show that a high degree of variation in tissue Hg is attributable to geographic location within south Florida, usually because of known differences in either prey consumed or Hg concentrations in prey. Prey identity may be strongly shaped by local community structure—for example bass in canals have access to a more diverse group of prey and larger prey than those foraging in marshes. Similarly, shifts in panther food habits and consequently Hg exposure have been strongly affected by changes in available prey, driven by hydrology or ungulate management practices. While trophic position can be important in predicting Hg exposure (panthers, mosquitofish), it is interesting that in some cases (bass) geographic location may have an even stronger effect. Each of these species or species-groups has shown value as an indicator of risk, with large variation seen in Hg concentrations over both time and space. The ability to attribute that variation to location, trophic, and contaminant exposure effects has been a major contribution of these long term studies.},

An analysis of tide gauge data indicates these destructive tides were frequent, and predictable across seasons. This colony is growing in size, and there is circumstantial evidence of breeding site fidelity despite the washovers. This is surprising, since White Ibises are known for frequent colony shifts. Although egg predation at this colony was comparatively low, and clutch size comparatively high, breeders still suffered far more total nest loss than at other coastal colonies. I suggest White Ibises do not use nesting failure, or predictability of failure as cues for abandonment, but rely on environmental cues such as local food availability and frequency of nest-site predation instead.},

	abstract = {Accurate measurements of food consumption by young birds are of great value in a variety of ecological studies, but traditional measurement methods are problematic and prone to high error. In animals that obtain their water primarily through food, it is possible to estimate food consumption from measurements of water influx rate, using radioactively labeled water (3H2O), and diet water content. We evaluated that method by comparing actual food consumption with simultaneous estimates of food consumption based on the labeled-water method in captive-reared nestling Tricolored Herons (Egretta tricolor). There was good agreement. The average error in the isotope method was −2\% (SD = 8\%), and that difference was not statistically significant. An errors analysis indicated that the accuracy of this method is sensitive to determinations of dietary water content and animal body water content, and to estimates of rates of metabolic water production and unidirectional water vapor input.},

	abstract = {Activity patterns of fledgling storks (Ciconiidae) during the parental-dependency period are poorly understood for many species, including the Wood Stork (Mycteria americana). Satellite telemetry was used to track the movements of fledgling Wood Storks ( n = 50) from the time they attained minimum flight capabilities until dispersal from the natal colony. Distances traveled, range size, and habitat use by fledgling Wood Storks were quantified for early (prior to the final week before dispersal) and late (the final week before dispersal) predispersal periods and for the entire predis-persal period as a whole. Metrics were compared among three colonies and between two years at a single colony using nonparametric tests. For the entire predispersal period, the mean daily maximum distance of juvenile Wood Storks from their nest was 1.39 ± 0.2 km (median = 0.18 and maximum = 103.13) and the mean cumulative distance moved per day was 2.38 ± 0.28 km (median = 0.45 and maximum = 110.58). Movement distances differed among colonies and between years, while core and total ranges were similar regardless of location. The majority of locations (84\%) occurred within colony boundaries, 95\% occurred within 1.0 km of the colony and 98\% occurred within 3.5 km of the colony. Flight distances did not increase linearly with time and instead followed a Poisson distribution, increasing sharply during the final week before dispersal. Habitat management recommendations for juvenile Wood Storks are to preserve wetland features within a 1.0–3.5 km zone around a colony.},

	abstract = {Counts of nest starts are often used as indicators of the size of avian nesting populations, or of avian productivity. However, the accuracy of single or repeated counts of unmarked nests over time for estimating seasonal numbers of nests may be strongly affected by nest events that fall in between survey dates, or that occurred prior to or after the survey period. Accuracy may also be affected by uncertainty in the interpretation of counts due to overlap between starting and ending dates of asynchronous nests during the intervisit interval. To measure the combined magnitude of these effects on survey accuracy, we overlaid a monthly “survey” regime on known initiation and ending dates of 2055 nests of ciconiiform birds. Assuming all nests present on the date of simulated survey were counted, monthly surveys underestimated the true number of nest starts by 24–64\%, depending on species and year. Using a simple model, we also demonstrate that accuracy does not increase much as survey frequency increases, and that significant estimation error can occur over a wide range of nest success values and degrees of asynchrony. We suggest that (1) these biases can be significant for surveys of many kinds of nesting birds including some territorial passerines, (2) this bias cannot be addressed by increasing survey frequency, and (3) the degree of renesting may be of critical interest for inferring breeding population size from nest count data. We suggest three possible approaches for modeling this error.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of aerial estimates of avian aggregation sizes is variable across studies, and the relative importance of techniques and inter-observer error to this variation are poorly understood. Using a scaled physical model of a wading bird colony, we examined accuracy and variation in observer counts of simulated large numbers (200-6000) of densely nesting birds in vegetated situations. Observer estimates averaged 29\% less than true numbers (under- and overestimates averaged together), and the mean absolute value of observer errors was 49\% of true values. We found no effects of the size of the aggregation, the experience of the observer, the size of the previous aggregations surveyed by observers, the use of corrective lenses, or fatigue on degree of individual error. Over- and underestimates by individuals did not tend to cancel out in estimates by individuals of a "population" of colonies. Photographic counts of the same trials were significantly more accurate than observer estimates. We suggest that many studies using estimates of large numbers of birds may be confounded by similar errors. We urge that researchers use caution in interpreting the results of past surveys and develop ways to minimize, measure, and correct for visual estimation error within individuals and among observers. /// La exactitud de los estimados aéreos de agregaciones de aves es muy variable en los diferentes estudios que se han hecho. La importancia relativa de las técnicas y el error interobservador, que introducen estas variaciones, ha sido pobremente entendido. Utilizando un modelo físico a escala de una colonia de vadeadores, examinamos la exactitud y la variación en los observadores en conteos de simulaciones de densas colonias de aves anidando en vegetación, y en grandes números (200-6000 individuos). Los estimados de los observadores promediaron un 29\% menos que los verdaderos números (incluidos bajo y sobre estimados juntos) y la media absoluta promedio del error del observador fue de 49\% con respecto a los valores reales. No encontramos efecto en el tamaño de la agregación, la experiencia del observador, tamaño de la agregación previamente censada por el observador, el uso de lentes correctivos, o la fatiga en el grado de error del observador. Los bajo o sobre estimados por individuos no tendieron a cancelar el estimado por individuo de una "población" de colonias. Los conteos fotográficos del mismo evento fueron significativamente más exactos que los estimados de los observadores. Sugerimos que muchos estudios que han utilizado estimados de grandes agregaciones de aves pueden haber cometidos errores similares. Los investigadores deben tener precaución en la interpretación de los datos obtenidos de censos originados de estimados visuales. Se deben desarrollar formas de minimizar, medir y corregir los estimados visuales dentro de grupos de individuos y entre observadores.},
